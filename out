But they got other qualities emasculating them
Ya I think they're better at talking to girls
I agree
True actually
In their behavior
Are much more inclined to be effemiante
All the dudes I know who have near aged sisters
Maybe. I don't strongly believe this lol. Just my initial impressions.
A bit
But ya also mentally ill
Personality
Def beta
And shit
The dudes surrounded by sisters
Look at hab
Approaches
Its
Irs more likely
Just as It approached the males age
Don't really have a distinct range in mind
Idk.  I imagine tho as it gets closer to the male the more chance of catching effeminate
Hm
But as a general rule
Exceptions
Obvi there are exceptiok
They just act more effeminate
Inb4 Matt screenshots to pire
Near aged sister
Is a huge beta
That kid
Look at gray
He just adopted effeminate behavior
I think there is a strong positive correlation between growing up with near aged sisters and being beta
But
Ya he's obvi not that lol
Nothing to do with looks
The reason mo still creeping is because he got a beta personality
Lol wut
Y'all are clowns
Stop spamming the chat with this nonsense
I do solve crimes nigga. No pretend
So given all this u should have been able to deduce quite quickly that Zach is 4th. The fact that u didn't or couldn't is kind of concerning
Probably not
Plus Zach has said several times he's either going bell Barkley or dj. Could the 9th pick get any of those?
I did that in my head in like 2 secs
That's simple ass deduction neil. Get good
You're 10. 

Mos 1 and u know that from constantly wanting to trade with him.

I'm 7 and u know that because you've talked shit about my position several times. 

Matt's 3 and u know that because you've mocked with him and he announced it at the beginning. 

Kartiks 2 and you know that because you've mocked with him. 

Chris is 8 and u know that because you have mocked with him.

Mike is 5 and you should know that because he has said explicitly several times "5 is the best draft spot my spot is going to be sick"

Sid is 6 and you should know that because either you've mocked with him and he's been in the Barkley conversation forever (Barkley is ranked 6th).

So the only two whose positions should have been slightly blurry are Zach and Ivan. And that's only the 4 and 9 picks
Simple deduction would yield zachs draft position . u must be really slow at that
More probably
Like how do u not know what zachs position is.. Its been screenshotted or said explicitly at least 5 times
I'm always thinking "is this dude trolling or just stupid"
Is like that
Almost everything he says
Does anyone else struggle often to tell whether Neil's trolling
Z never gives genuine answers
Lolol
Who u going 2nd round baby
What up z baby
Leave Sid alone
Lucky
Lol
Ivan
What college did ab go to
Lol
Ur
Ut
Lets test it knowledge
Ivan
U don't even know what college ab or Julio went to
Mad dog
U got some strats eh
I would have made adjustments that would have made it look like it never happened
I would have seamlessly recovered
At all times
I speak like a reasonable man
Only annoying cuz y'all are dull
Psh
20 times
You've said all these things
That's big ups to me
Made top 3
I had like a bottom 3 draft
That's big ups to me
My draft was one of the worst
I agree. For what I drafted being 3rd is a huge compliment
I don't think
Not too muh
The plays are made after draft day
From draft day to championship
My team was entirely different
Draft hardly matters
How many times do I have to say bud
A lot of people were
But neil was high on him too
I was
Tho
You're still a beta
I acknowledge
My team played bad
You're the biggest beta in here
Group Bitch voted for "mo" in the poll: who has the lowest T in this chat?
Ya they did u beta
From all this
That's what I've gathered
Yall are low t af
Not
No any more dumb than restricting our pick time would be
Is high test
Drafting with possibility of injuries and role changes
Drafting before preseason is high test. Yet none of y'all wanted that
Psh u wanna talk about high test
Have to for what end
Lol what u mean u have to
And I think it would be more fun than a quick time crunched draft
I don't see any downsides to doing this basically
If Sid is up to pick and he is busy well give him an extension
If people need more time well give it
I think
It will be more suspenseful and fun this way
Well have our first few rounds selected by draft day
Etc
Then matt then z
Once mo goes kartik on the clock for an hour
For each pick
I say everyone should get an hour
Anyone who goes against would be severely penalizedb
It would be fun
Where we just reveal our picks in order
Idk why we couldn't just do this slow draft I suggested
He's fine
And lets get this thing started
Pick someone
Stop bein a birch
He'll be there for week 1
He's fine man
Bio
Look at bells boi
Step up
What are u a girl who has to look at her outfits for hours
Man up and choose someone beta
Psh
By far
That's one of the most beta traits
Nah you're the most indecisive kid
Indecision
Is beta af
Indecisio
That's so beta
How have u not figured who you're going to yet man
But what's wrong with announcing it
Sure
Zeke
"I already got see"
"Mike just announce you're going fournette already"
One of the dullest
Dull
Really dukl
You're a loony man
My suggestion is an extension of what u said before me
Are u a psycho tho bro
My suggestion *
Its convenient for everyone
No need to do this tho. Lets do what suggestion
Basically
High maintenance bitcb
"Its too hot in this basement im going home"

My thoughts "this kid is actually a little birch"
You're a huge girl bro
Especially u mo
Yall little. Girls
Not even close
Personality wise im the most alpha in this league by far
With my proposal
2 of them just agreed
Stop talking basically
Or beneficial for me
Isn't even good
Your presence in here
Or anyone
No need to bash u
Anyway
Who spends time around u
To anyone
That's obvi
You're a huge beta in personality
Who gives a fuck
The cope is real
Keep coping bud
No comp
I know
You're personality is easily the most beta
That's facys
Srs
I don't know people who think you're alpha lol
You are bro
funny
You think you're an alpha LOL
Srs
Responses
Those are beta
I hate little birch responses like that
What are u mike now
Don't just come in here like a little birch and say that sgit
Speak up @Mo Latif
What's wrong with it then bud
My suggestion for simulated draft is fine
What does he mean ah shuddup
This draft would have already happened if we didnt have to cater to your pampered ass
That's what I gotta say to you
You're vulgar and high maintenance man
What u mean
Too
Well see how far we can simulate until the real draft
We can do the draft slowly this way to. Well go one by one and there's basically no time limit
That way nobody is tempted
I mean if we really wanted. Anyone who drafts differently than their announcement will justreceive automatic losses
That way they'll think twice about doing it
Anyone who does different than their accouncment will receive a 10 point penalty every week
Convenient for everyone
We can literally just simulate the draft right now
Who u going
Kartik
Mos going zeke
Seriously
To do this
That's all that's required of him
Sid clearly has time to type in this chat
First few rounds even
At least first round
Everyone just announces their pick in the natural order
We can draft now without actually drafting
That way we don't even have to wait
Seriously
Lets just announce in order
Damn we could have drafted today
Lets draft at 9 pacific
Same
And get er done
Have a ESPN tab open
Nobody's going to be monitoring u at work then sid
Ok draft at 9 Pacific tonight
Good day gentlemen
Setttled
Tonight at 8
Ya know
I wanna bust y'all in this draft sooner rather than later is my thinking
The loonies have a lot of foresight
Rule 8457
According to the loony rulebook
On this league
I declare eminent domain
I didn't want to use this power
According to the loony rulebook
I have been invested that power
I declare imminent draft
As runner up
God dammit

You're going to be bottom 3
Eww
You're bound for deep depths of the standings this year my prophecy tells me
Can*
I gain discern whether Sid will have a successful fantasy season by his answer to this question:who is your favorite NFL team?
U will have no composure on draft day Sid. Your draft quality will suffer accordingly
Everything
That's what it takes to have a solid draft
Who will hAve the most composure come draft day
Obedient beta
U will u good beta
That's right
Why does draft time still say 8:30
Fellas fellas fellas. When we really assess the possible outcomes of this league is me winning it all not among the most probable of them?. Lets just call a spade a spade already. Y'all keep calling spades, diamonds
Rams for Superbowl basically
What u mean u  don't like him

Solid teams all around

I liked Chris team
If titans didnt get dion Lewis Derrick Henry would be a monster

Everyone y'all listed either isn't significant or will be fine for week 1

I basically agree with everything he said
Tho
He's speaks truth thi
Ramsey is hilarious
This article good
Lolol
Jalen Ramsey a dog tho. So I'm cool with the comparison lol
I just read first paragraph
Lolol it is
90% of my trash talking is retaliatory
I don't even talk that much trash tho. Mostly in retaliation
Lol
This is getting kind of ridiculous
I don't even Remmeber injuries happening this often in the regular season last yr
How are these injuries happening lol
Amen to that
Lol
Get paid
Top 4
Ya 5$ buy in
Ya
I feel like mo would be down
@Mo Latif
Does anyone else in here want to do fantasy investing?
How does the scoring work lol
Matchups?
Are there league standings ?
Email is ealfons2@illinois.edu
Lol ok sounds fun
Exactly
What is it
Lets do it. Id beat y'all in that too
Lets be real
You weren't going to get him anyway
Calm down buds
Becoming yo daddy in this league is my first priority yes
However
So no.. No u aren't
I woke up like 4 hours ago
And at seasons end I'm gonna ask u "now Ivan who's yo daddy?"
I'm gonna be yo daddy in this league @Ivan Zhou
That's pretty sick lol
He's been raking the past few weeks
30 fricken 7
He has 37 points for me in my money league today
This dude is unstoppable
Ez
Acuna jr hottest hitter in baseball @Mike Vacala
Lol
Always correct
Do y'all ever not agree with each other lol. Lets be real. Not like that's saying much
Ya neil
Lol
Folow
That doesn't foloe
That's the part
Now how you're going to further conldude that someone gets fucked
That's reasonable so far
Ok
Us
For hs
U should be able to write it real easy
If its so basic
ð»
Ur
Lets see it equations
Maybe
Bad math
How is that person fucked
What u talking about
He almost made playoffs
Matt's number one pick was out for season last yr
Lol what?
We would postpone draft to prevent one injury
U srs
1 injury...
Then
What number is fair
9 more to go for each
So so far were at 1/10 injuries and 1/10 intel
Ill probably count that as 1/10 instances of Intel tho
Well see how many games he actually misses
"No formal timeline"
Jeffreys status was sketchy as of July 26th
And the only injury of substance is guice. Whether abs injury will impact anything in regular season is still up in the air
We knew he was injured
So we cant count that
Ay that happened before preseason tho
Minus less
Same time frame: slightly less than a month less to recover before regular season
He did more than limp then lol
Ab tore his calf against the patriots the 3rd to last game. Comes back less than a month later and goes for 7 receptions 132 yards and 2 tds in the playoffs against the best defense in the league the jags. 

Calm down bois
I don't see problem
Do rapids right after draft
Can't rapids wait for an hour?
How can he not find one hour
I agree
Can't the rafting people wait for u
Seriously
I'm on the sorry z train too
Lol
Just give me a list of like 3-4 realistic dudes u want in each round
Leaving it inn the hands of autodrsft might not be ideal
I can easily do it for him
If he just gives me a list of dudes he wants
Just give me your list
If u want me to
U
I mean I can draft for h
That actually wouldn't be too bad
Lol
Then
So what alternative days do u have in mind for draft
That's rare
"Not suggest any alternative "
T..that's what I mean by inflexible lol
You've been like that for a long time
If they aren't able to meet that time you'll just say something to the effect of "welp imma do it"and then not suggest any alternative
Today is a good example. You tell bz and gray "I'm going biking Saturday morning. Y'all should come"

If they aren't able to do that I guarantee you won't adjust the rest of your schedule to accommodate a time when they're able and willing"
You don't adjust your plans for others. U expect them to do it for u
That's how its been for a while
Literally with everything
And if people can't meet than time its more of a "well I'm going regardless" and not a "ok well then what time works for y'all lets do that "
Like you suggest a time
Hangouts
Even just with hangours
But that doesn't change what I said
Sure
Srs
More than all the parents I know
Not even close
Easily the most inflexible dude I know
Your schedule is by far the most inflexible
Ok find someone else to replace u in this league then
Pitching not deep enough
Nah
U wish
Psh
Now mikes gonna beat me!
Good going!
All because you're a *****
Now mikes got a solid pitcher
Well ****
Lol
Its significantly more smart than dropping one of your better pitchers..m
So I could get a start
Play a batter down
That's what I had to do today in my money league
If u did I guarantee there were dropavle dudes
Did u end up having a full batting lineup that day?
That's like one of your best pitchers
Why would u ever drop the ace of the braves
Why didn't u drop one of your shittyt batters
There wasn't a single other dude u could have dropped.
Lol oh
Its only fair
I mean. I made Robert drop markakis hader and ottavino for mike
The only reason Matt dropped him is because he doenstbgive a fuck about this league
Its not fair u have him
Drop newcomb
Btw mike
Beat*
Best*
Yeah right mikes gonna be u clown
Ill screenshot
....
Lets keep track
Ok 1/10 big injuries
Wow
I don't see it anywhere
What's the source matt
They said initial diagnosis was sprained mcl
No way lol
Who u going at 8 Chris
Chiefs batter than raiders
Nah
Ew
U said they Winnin division
A couple weeks ago
U said u liked chiefs
Hmm?
Barring injury obvi
So those two necessarily gonna dominate
Those teams will both make playoffs and only way that's happening is if those two dominate
Simple
Thus they won't bust
But they're going to be good
But I also don't see them being good if hunt and Fournette bust
I just don't see either of those teams being bad
Tell me if y'all agree with this simple argument for why Fournette and hunt won't bust.

If Fournette and hunt bust then the jags and chiefs won't be good teams next year. They will be good teams next yr therefore those two won't bust
Sid
Don't u dare take ab before me
Do take him*
Or me
Probably unless Chris or Ivan don't take him
Maybe he can get obj
Actually
At 15
Unless Sid takes him
Nah almost for sure
"Face it mike youre getting Keenan allen"
Lol I was just about to say that
U going obj mike?
That's all I gotta say
You gonna be 4-2 at best after 6 weeks mo
Actually 1 and 6 is fine
Spread that last one out
Ya I agree
Or u a lame boa
U better have a sick team name mo
I'm taking over
Over or under 30 times Jamal clapped jess
No lol
I got best team name and logo
Nah easily me
Lame ass team dean
What's ur team name gonna be this yr dean
H..has Jess ever hinted at it
When u tying the knot matt
Congratulations chris

Because I know you're going to go against it
But I just revealed that I dont
I really wanted to play mo
See I used double reverse
*
Play mo
Im smart
(I'm using reverse psychology here. I'm requesting Matt to play Matt yet all the while I know very well that Matt won't respect my requests. So he'll match me up with someone else which is what I really want because I'm scared to play mo to tell u he truth )
Give the fans what they want
Make it happen matt
You know That's what the fans wanna see
U like that mo?
@Mo Latif super bowl rematch week 1 me and u

Low-key tho I got a sick spot

Too predictable mart
I knew u were going to include 8 9 and 10
The second u said I feel bad for anyone out of top 6
That was so obvious
Lolol
Nah lemme get dj
I'm most interested to see who sid goes
Bet
Then
Wow. Mikes getting barkleu
Who u going
The big 4 and Barkley are gone sid
@Siddharth Bhaduri
So now its on sid
Mad money said he's either going big 4 or Barkley
Now zs up
I already know you're going bell
Matt's going bell
Who u going
So if its dj and Barkley up z
Is the question of the day
Is Matt going dj or bell
Now we move on to mike
Ok
Is what I've gathered from this
So you're going Barkley
Are u going Barkley or not
Zach
Lemme get Ivan week one
Let me get some variety week one
When dean gets in
Lets switch this up matt
U
Why didnt grant me this wish
I said kartik
U asked me who I wanted week one matt
Why do i play same opponent first week as last yr tho
U play z baby @Mo Latif
Should be interesting
Lol i play Chris first
Ya I think ivans draft is gonna be worst
Elliot. Gurley. Bell. Barkley. Dj. Hunt. Fournette. Gordon. Cook. Kamara
Hm
Imma find out!
Ohhh mike sent me a pic of his rankings!
Mike
Lemme see ur rb rankings again
When it comes down to it
I feel like mike won't go dj tho
He would go him lol
Mik just said
Who's Sid going tho
Mikes going Fournette
Z will
I really want to see who mike goes if Barkley is gone
Lol
Matt's going to try the dj experiment again
So are u going dj then matt
Pretend Barkley is gone
If he falls are u taking him
Sid. How much u like dj?
Sike
Ya these games sure changed my outlook
Lol
Now its on mike
So we know top 4 in order
Then saquon
Ill bet my life
In that order
Its going to be zeke Gurley bell
Matt taking bell
Ya
So what u doing in light of that mike
Privately
Privatleyb
He already told me
Zachs taking Barkley mike
So I can plan accordingly
Who you're going
Y'all need to tell me
Mike and sid
Chubb
I wasn't high on him. Were y'all?
By us
Yet they aren't going to be close to drafted
Look around the league today. There were a plethora of running backs who did well
Barkley had one 30 yard run and Y'all are jizzing in your pants
I haven't been told a single thing insightful yet
I know Kartik. That's why I asked what y'all learned today
U hilarious matt
Lololol
I wouldn't legitimately grade anyone's performance after 5 carries
Poorly on 5 carries
That really is the question isn't it
That was so helpful guys! I'm glad we postponed our draft to really learn from that!
Wow Barkley had 5 carries for 43 yards!!! Wow!!! That showed us so much more about his potential than we already knew!
That's a real solid start
True
Ya. We definitely didn't know that
Whose roles did you guys get a better sense of
What did y'all learn from the games as it concerns roles
Back to my question
That's cool bro
That's for sure
I don't
I can't say they do
Tho
As for u
Lets be real they definitely do
I asked a specific question which applied to TODAY'S games
U dull bro?
Same questions
Plz do tell
What did y'all takeaway from these games today
H..how are they valuable lol
So who u going at 6 then sid
M..mike
Ima hog y'all some rats
Ima frog y'all some bats
Remember that
I'm the big dog in this league
Obvi
So ya
And I was a playoff team
Also: ya most if not all playoff teams rely on rbs within or near top 5 lol
Not as much will be told from the draft as u think
The spot doesn't really matter. My championship team didn't have a single player on its starting roster that it had on opening day. Not a single one.
I may be. But then again I may not
Lets see how smart u really are
And afc
In nfc
Who will make the NFL playoffs this yr
Tell me
Sid
Nah news is saying its minor
Don't let him fool u
Mos going elliot
Cuz I'm taking them
U better not
I mean hunt was 3 kamara 4 lol
Landry is that dude
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDluZUVROlc&feature=share
I'm getting barkley
That's a tough decision
I'm pretty sure he's slipping to at least 8.
On a different note: who's getting kamara?
Humans as a collective group
We determine the truth
In what way?
Is his definition "more truthful" than mine?
When I went to define it sid had misgivings about my definition. And that seemed to imply he had another definition in mind. If he did and that definition was such that love can't be quantified then so be it. But nothing about sids definition corresponds to something in the world.
That was another way to say that there isn't anything "objective" about "love".

Its just another word under our control to define
When we let these words remain vague our subsequent usage of them will probably cause us to misunderstand each other
That we find*
So that find common ground and so we're not talking past one another when we use words like "love, beauty etc."
So that we can standardize everything
We should recognize everything as able to be quantified
This goes hand in hand with my argument about quantification
Especially moral relativism
Relativism is a hindrance to progress
You too much of a relativist
When we rate girls attractiveness you say "each ethnicity has hot girls and each doesn't we can't compare"

Uhh we can take their ratings and average them no?
You always use that reasoning mo
Football would have higher
If u took all their athletic scores and divided by total amount of players
Were talking on avergaev
Sure..
*
Small forwards
Power forwards are meh
Other than lebron
Them in athetlic competition
I think linebackers would kill
Linebackers vs power forwards
I would take d lineman over center all day
Power forwards and center are too tall and therefore too clumsy to be athletic
I don't deny that
Them
What about then
Or at least much less so
I don't think that's possible in football
U can thrive in basketball and not be that athletic
Doesn't require athleticism as much
Basketball is more technical imo
Far more
I promise u he's more athletic than Tim duncan
Now give me one of the best lineman ever
Is Tim Duncan athletic?
U serious mo
Tim duncan
Yet he's one of the best centers ever
That dude ain't athletic
Like Cmon now
Take shaq
They Just recruit tall dudes
Height is way too gimmicky in basketball
Football players def more athletic
In that sense they're neutral
"Atypical format" and "nobody signed up for it".

I wouldn't use either of these criteria in my judgement for further rules
I think you misundersdod me
In the sense that one shouldn't factor in those in their decision to vote
That's where the scales tip
But then u factor in benefits from pick swaps
They're neutral
And the fact that "nobody signed up for it"
So that's not a good analogy
And this poll includes action taken on oneself
You see something wrong with it with respect to yourself tho matt
Are those inherently bad
Ok...
Lol
Yet u voted no
U don't see anything wrong with it chrid
Group Bitch voted for "Yes" in the poll: allow pick swaps?
Then we won't
If majority says no
Lets vote
This is all besides the point tho
For a few days
I was busy
I've done this since day 1
Has this morning been atypical lol
Doesn't mean u have to shove that on us
Just because u take everything at face value chris
Maybe you're not familiar
Its called arguing
Whining lol
That's another reason this league weak af
That work ethic
You're missing something
But
Matt i know u like to model your leadership style off of trump
Why do we have a lazy gm man
I.. Will do everything
I..I just said
.........
....
Goes
But we know how that goed
I would ask mike to defend lol
Id have this league running smoother than a babies bottom
Ill never complain about workload
For real
Give me gm man
Like Cmon with this pussy shjt
Ill keep track man
Y..you aren't high test are u
If you're as high test as u think
Anyways. Lets trade spots matt
What u mean
In
Its not on our hands at that point
Were just worried about it getting vetoed
What u mean make it work
Well be in same room lol
And I trust mo
Obvi neil
What u mean matt
But when it actually happens they might not
Without seeing the players they would probably consent
That's what mos worried about anyway
Because its possible that the league would consent to a pick swap but potentially see the players and think they're not actually equal in value
Make that a rule
If they screw up we ain't restarting shit
Screws up?
If u can't handle this workload
Dude
Give me gm then dudr
How is that work lol
Nullifying someone's point s?
Will there be
What work or risk
What u mean risk work
Plz tell me why we can't Matt given that solution
This is a very easy solution
I still don't understand why we can't trade individual picks.

If a member keeps one of the players whom he was supposed to take for another then Matt can just nullify his points until he trades him
Lets trade spots
Yo matt
Those dudes won't fall far from the big 3
Barkley Fournette Gordon hunt David johnson
I don't think rbs 4-8 will be behind the top 3 by very much
Honestly there are like at least 7-8 of those
Why is 4 the best spot ?
Sigh
Its really a shame we have to just sit here and merely talk about this
I guarantee he plays this yr neil
Lol
He's risky
Ya nobody draft him first round
Let me get ur spot tho
No specific rounds
We can't trade specific picks. Only entire spots
Lol. Matt said we can't do that
No
You take 7 I get 5?
Yo @Mike Vacala you wanna trade spots in the pick order?
Bich
No
Lol dude
Yr
Psh u gon get smacked this ur boi
Over a large sample size
It shows quality long term
Eh. Points against comes into play then. And that has nothing to do with how good your team is tho. 

Points for is the most convincing indicator of a teams quality
Psh u were worse
It began really good
But ur team as it evolved was so bad
The people who made playoffs deserve their next preseason shit talking liberty
My rb1 is gonna plunder all the booty u got
Imma have my way with u matt
And as for u matt
I'm pillaging your village
And what's more
And I'm taking no prisoners
I'm coming for your team this year z
ð»
Ya sure
Oh
Ya obvi
And I trust him to trade me the players he selects for me
I know mo and I will be able to execute this because we will be in same room on draft day
Everyone is held responsible for his trade swap
Shake
Lol
Nah
Lol
Lol
How mediocre we talking l l
Zactly
Mark Ingram old and washed up...he's 28
U beta
Ahh make a high test trade already matt
Balls in your court now
There I said it
I shake
Alright @Mo Latif
Lol
I trade U Gurley for cook and obj neil
Move it back to 145
Matt
How does that work this yr
Ill have my answer
Ok when the clock says 1 3 5
Lol
A..
S..sh
Boi I said u say it first
That's trust fellaa
I don't have to worry that mos keeping my pick
Right mo
I feel confident that mo will trade me the players I tell him. And he trusts me
Ok mo say shake
Until u trade bim
You'll be effectively kicked out of league
U
For
Matt will suspend points
Room for error for what
Easiest solution
Obviously lol
We just ask the person. To pick
Does it conflict with ours
Hey!
Or you're a chicken
Bich
U say it first then
Srs
I think I am
Yo
...
Imma fantasy juggernaut
Lol
The fuck up
You're right!
Oh ya!
Lol no
34
Neil
Ok
I said gimme a bit bich
:)
Give me a little to think
Ok
Wow those 20s
I won't
Very simple
*offers hand for confirmation handshake*
Lol
True
40
Ok deal
That's decent
Is it?
Hm
You're a hard bargain
1st and 4th
Hm
No
Deal
Ok
Ya
4th
Nah
And u know that
Hey. Its valuable
Q
Q z
Its #47
5th round is inn the 40s
No
Y..yes
For real
U want that
Mark it down
Bet
My #1 and #5 for your 1 mo
Gulp
M..my 2nd and 4th picks
Plz
Me
Likes
Mo really like ten huh neil
H..heh
ð»
There are some pretty consistent patterns
It just gets u a sense of where players fall
Ya
Write it down
10 for each
Intel
10 pieces of key ingel
10 impactful injuries
That sounds like a fair number
10 matt
But it will be enlightening
Isn't necessarily sufficient for my conclusion
It's only evidence true
Ya obvi
I expect y'all to concede
If we don't see that tho
That y'all had a decent argument
If I see enough impactful role chAnges and injuries ill definitely concede
Well see how seriously this preseason ought to have been taken in a few weeks bois
Imma gonna lol
Seriously tho I can't wait ill the preseason ends and I look at all the role changes and injuries in retrospect and hardly see impacy
See y'all then
ð»
Then
Lets just do 8/25
What are real choices then
That ain't even a choice
Lol
Imma choose 8/5
Shit if this is going to slide to highest pct
I mean. Do we have to choose 8/17 as ours
I believe me mo and z at least
Ok. Lets get all 10 in
I said that sounds reasonable lol
Justification for what matt
Y'all have covered em
There is. Nothing else u got to say
I acknowledge all my faults
I'm like Eminem in 8 mile
Lets get that stuff behind us tho
We know
Yes we know
When u say that
Are u sure u know what you're talking about
Plz
Btw Chris cite a single time I've strawmanned
That's somewhat reasonable
That sounds like it would solve it
Why wouldn't we lol
He'll ya
Nah votes should always have justification or we go middle ground. That should be an axiom
I.e.. 17th
That's why I'm bargaining for middle ground
I know matt
We've gone over this
Is mere injuries
Is that the only thing that should be taken into account
How do u figure
And that reasoning is sufficient matt
I'm asking u to clarify
Does he matt
Lol Chris really doesn't want to reveal it
I'm waiting !
"Because we all do"
You're weak af
Brah
Gtfo
Lolol
Matt
That's a reasonable man eh
LOL
Scared of what idk
U scared
Do it u wont
Recite it
Where!?
Y'all do!?
"Because we all do"
"Because we all do"
For your argument u all have
I'm waiting
So Chris
Don't u think something is off
Matt is this how Chris normally acts
I said this a thousand times lol
What of it
That's true
"Because we all do"
Chris
What's the argument u guys all.have
You'd be defending a loony
Ya u better gulp
Lol
Clear this up matt
What is Chris saying
Can u understand what's going on
Matt
Recite it for me
Really what is it?because I don't recall it having any substance
You guys do?
"Because we all do"
How yours is substantiated yet mine isnt
Plz explain chris
Yours is on same level as me
No u dont
Uh no
A substantiated one
Why do u keep repeating it
That I can't substantiate my argument
I already said bud
Its weird
I can't tell if you're trolling me
No argument for what
What to say
Idk
If u didn't jeez
Did u drink
Be serious tho
I don't think you're competent enough for this
How about u take a rest for the night man. Come back sober tomorrow
U have
Lol I knew it
Don't lie to me
Be serious
Tonight
Did u drink
Answer me this
That's no doubt
You're def drunk
What are u saying
You're embarrassing
If you're sober right now
You sound off the wall
Look at u
Bro
Have
I don't
That
I just said
Did u drink tonight lol
Lol are u drunk
Why are u asking again
Didn't I already say I can't substantiate it. Or at least that it would be far too difficult
Concerning this argument
Who has provided a single thing substantiated
By all means
Please show me your calculation then chris
Lol what
They haven't
Why wouldn't I
They haven't tho...
Honest
What do u mean by honesy
So I can lol
Someone please make explicit whatever your "deepest level" is
What does that mean?
"Deepest level"
Do u read lol
I just acknowledged neither of us has a good case
When did I say my argument was strong lol
That's probably the most discernable thing in their whole calculation.
The only clear thing in their minds is "I'm going to do the opposite of whatever Eric does"
And cloudy
It must be very fuzzy
I really want to see how they're rationalizing this to themselves
What does it come out to
In their calculation
If they include the benefit received from trading more time to scout waivers more time to prepare for byes
I want to see it
What does their utility calculation look like
Given the loop that I threw in the argument (trading for one month ) these people can't even rationalize their choice of 9/1 to themselves lol
If neither side can adequately justify I really don't know why we don't meet in middle
Doesn't matter lol...
Drafting 9/1
Standard
That's standars
But
Without good justification on your end
I imagine that's what will happen in the end anyway
Man
Yallare wack
Why did all of y'all vote 8/17 just a couple hours ago lol
^^
After preseason and before
August 17th is middle
For their argument
Neither side can build a concrete case
Why would we not meet in middle
Sigh
Group Bitch voted for "8/17" in the poll: Draft date?
Just short time ago
Want me to quote "I agree"
Nothing?
Once I'm around
Then he's too scared to defend any of his claims
When I get there
But
When he's talking to mo about arguing things
Mike talks a big game lol
I might say trading for ab would benefit me by a value of 5
In any reasonable amount of time. Well debate over values too
None of us will show that
I'm not sure why I was the object of humiliation
Y'all act like u don't have the burden of showing some kind of formula for your after preseason vote lol
Yes mike we know u believe that
That's already decided
8 17 kartik
I actually think I'm better at anything we could do
Like
Are u even good at anything mike lol
I'm an idiot why lol
Defend it with some stats
You made that claim bud
"Drafting before preaseason isn't optimal"
Are u
U ain't laughing now
Show us
Defend it boa
U made the optimal claim lol
What u laughing about mike
How would u show that chris
17th
So let's meet in middle
Neither of us will be able to show this
Number and impact
Variables
Both of those
I would say some kind of formula which weighs fantasy impact and amount of players.
Just very minimally
I'm not denying that they happen
Yes.. That's a point I acknowledge mike lol
Or was it before
Did Edelman get hurt pre-season
Ok 4 dudes maybe 1 of whom were going to be starters
Was he even going to be rostered
Who is that
Quincy who mike
2 players
If I really wanted to
I mean I could quantify it
I'm basically saying that trades which occur during pre-season will have a bigger impact that roles and injuries
I Don't think either of us could find stats for our actual conclusions
Find me some statistics
Lets hear it mike
Mike seems to think he has some kind of argument
Y'all are the ones saying after preseason is optimal
I mean they could stub their toe
To the point that it impacts their draft value?
Someone do that
Plz
The ability to trade will outweigh injuries. I want y'all to find me a stat of how many fantasy rostered players incur injuries in preaseaob
Sure Kartik. So what
U care to respond mike
I already made my case for trades outweighing info from roles and injuries. Y'all have yet to respond to that case. So I will take your silence as a clear refutation by me
Or no?
And refuted likewise?
I would love to see it
Plz
Argue your case
Favor
Plz do us a davoe
Plz mike
Y'all haven't convinced me
Not me
Idk that's on y'all to fin
Pay me all money ill refund all. And ill do the random number generator
Ill take the burden of rectifying it all
Y'all can redo all of that
That wasn't sufficient
I did I agree
The fuck
I asked for refund well before picks
U srs lol
Which is what were debating about
Because that only occurred once I was denied refund
Any time wasted after I initially asked for refund shouldn't be counted obviously
Y'all are trolls
I'm only talking to Matt lol
After*
Don't count a single thing whicb happened before I initially began asking for refund
I just wanted some form of compensation
That wasn't even a real rule I argued for
We only revealed it because I wasn't getting my money back
We hardly spent any time
Easily rectified
Buy in and reveal of draft order
You named two things
What rules have we even spent like 20 minutes debating lol
Debating rules
You're crazy
On what !!
Hours!!!
Very easily
Say
I can counter everything u day
In
So it would be as if nobody every bought it
"People bought in knowing these rules"

Give me the. Money back and ill refund them all
Its very simple
Give me the money and ill give them it all back
Like I said man
If you wanna appeal to wasting time
Give me the burden of changing all of these
U act like these things are set in stone bro
Chance that too
So what change it. Send me all the money in one lump sum Matt and ill incur the burden of paying people back
All u can name is the buy in price
We hardly made any
Redo all the rules.its very simple
How much time did I actually waste
Wasted
I wanted
Name the rules and name how much time
Let me know
Plz
Bro
What rules did I even establish vro
Why does establishing rules matter man
Address what I'm saying tho
Its very much within reason to let a person who wants to leave A MONTH BEFORE the season to leave with full refund
Reasonable ness
Matt
Because that person expects fairness
I don't think you guys have this well thought out
Lets seriously argue this
Why would someone have to find a replacement for themselves
Not adequately at least
That rule was never justified btw
Did he give a reason?
Why did Casey leave again Matt?
To do it
I really wouldn't be afraid
If it was out matt
Test me
Y'all are weak
It don't even matter
Ill beat y'all even if my best player gets hurt
A relatively early draft date
Because that's the chief thing I desire
Does
Ya only if everyone foes
I don't need shit. Y'all don't give shit
If that works for y'all then lets do it
I'm fine with it
Lets do august 17th bois
Heh
Use our funds
I voted for it lol
^
Just go with it z
August 17th
Be reasonable men
Cmon Neil.Chris or kartik
So that's 5
Tho
Count z as 17th
There's a poll right up there
Works
Either time
Couldn't be more perfect
Perfect day
Lets get it bois
August 17th 8:30
Group Bitch voted for "yes" in the poll: Draft August 17th, Friday night 830pm.
Srs tho
If you're competent enough
Cliffs mike
Sid
Quit that sif
For real
Group Bitch voted for "yes" in the poll: Cool with drafting around August 20thish.
Think of it in a better light
I'm giving u words of encouragement not begging
I..im sorry?
I believe in u
U got this
Make it happen before work
That works
Ok
Ok pay by then
So help me out
But its true
Yes. Its embarrassing I know
I'm way ahead of u
Cmon now
Like I haven't tried lol
It takes like a minute
U
I promise j
Your job isn't that important man
Like everyone I know who has a job is able to access chase or w.e. their bank is at some point to make a money transfer bro
Do..do u get no breaks or something
You'll be able. So just pay now man
If your only concern is that you'll simply "be able" to draft then you need not worry
Why are u afraid to pay Casey?they just said they're fine with any day. You'll be able to draft trust me
Ill get it when I get it... No shit lol
What information does that even give me
U like saying obvious stuff or
"You'll get you're money when you get it"
Ok @Casey LaPointe. U hear that. They're basically fine with any day
August 26th or September 3rd
Ok then just @Siddharth Bhaduri @Chris Chan
Have fun
So hav
I don't envy that either way
That you're working currently
I pity u
Its a Saturday bud
Then just @Chris Chan @straight hype @Siddharth Bhaduri
Ok
Are y'all able to draft on either September 3rd or august 26th
The only people we really have to work around are @straight hype@Siddharth Bhaduri @Chris Chan @Neil Nijhawan
Do these days work for all the rest of you guys^?
Group Bitch created a poll: Does September 3rd draft work?
Ok. Any other days around then
Because they're on west coast
Because that's too early
Ya they said they're not trying to do that
Calm down
Nobodies forcing u to do anything
U can answer these at anytime lol
But you said u could only do mornings
I know most of them wanted to do it on September 1st
Check your schedule
What days around labor day work for u @Casey LaPointe
I know I know
If its before that
So u having 5 days off doesn't matter
The problem is I don't think these dudes want to draft until preseason is basically over
Just put down any possible date
Ok. What else other than Saturdays
Ya
Do any of those work for u at any time?
Casey
From here on out
Probably most Saturdays
You got my hopes up
Damn
Oh lol
I like how u think
Neil
Yes
Then I'm handcuffed to this league forever
Ok. Do it as soon as possible! For the good of the league Casey!
@Casey LaPointe
Lol. Have u looked at ur calendar yet
These are facts men
Just look at him
I've explained that I'm leaving when I get my refund like 10 times. The fact that this dude says things like "when u leaving"


How can my claim that this dude asks 90% facetious questions not be taken somewhat seriously
The dudes a joke
Like he was legitimately looking for a genuine answer... He knows the answer I would give to him lol
"When u leaving?"
Am I wrong
I say this dude only asks facetious questions bois
This is what I'm talking about
What answer were u looking to get from tnag quesrion
Is that not a perfect example of a facetious question
Its hilarious
With every word u speak u just substantiate my claims
Look at what u just asked
You already know when I'm leaving lol
Figure something out
Call him
U got Casey's number
You say the most inconsequential non constructive things
Lets see who's really talking bullshit
Copy paste everything you've said in the last two weeks in here
Look in the mirror
Honestly almost every thing you've said in the past couple weeks has been bullshit mike
How so
Would be easier lol
Clearly
Casey has a job
Mo and i
The only people who took long to pay are people who don't have jobs
Stop talking to me
Kartik you're ugly bro
Its the non loonies
Good
All the loonies are goof
So is z for the most part
So is mo
I'm going to assumed that mike and Matt are free af
All these schedule conflicts
Very hard
Kartik
I've tried very hard
Its that easy
Ill be. Gone very soon
I'm annoying af i know. So lets get me out of here asap. If y'all just cooperate
For casey
Y'all need to be flexible
Everyone get in here right now
Trolls
Id rather play with random than teols
Y'all are trolls
Y'all offer me no fantasy pleasure
At least as good as this matt
So idk what else to do
But this is unjust
I don't want to be
I know
Mikes actually being rational
Thank u mike
Yess
I'm harassing him?
Then you don't need to know
If this info doesn't expedite this process
Doesn't matter
I'm paying the site
I'm not paying a person
Its randomized
I don't know anyone from this league
Who is them?
I have to sign up and pay for this other league today
There's a sense of urgency here @Casey LaPointe
If that's all that mattered
Don't u think I would be much less urgent about this
So no merely getting my money back isn't all that matters
I want my refund asap
I don't see why u should be any different
We all paid before we knew draft date
Just pay today
If u paid come September then u might as well not even pay
Today preferably
Is what matters
Getting it soon
I have preference to draft early yet I still paid. If u have no preference Casey I'm sure u can find one of these next 30 days to draft
Especially if u don't have a preference like I do
I'm trying to convince him that he shouldn't fret about it: we didn't
I know. That's why I asked him
None of us knew it @Casey LaPointe 

We still paid
Just have the trust that everyone clearly showed by paying without knowing a draft date either
Why do u have to be the exception
You seriously think that you might pay and Y'all won't be able to find a mutual draft date@Casey LaPointe 


We literally all paid before we found out our draft date
Stop trolling
Be real tho is one week the earliest you're willing to pay
If you're not able to pay I won't be for now
Casey
If you're being serious we no longer have a need for u
Ok remove this dude
That defeats the whole purpose for me lol
Why that long
Srs
U are?
....
On ur break if u have one casey
Just look as soon as u get a chance
That's fine
Ok. Look as soon as u get a chance then
Is your schedule just completely random or something ?
Its a simple question
Just answer the question
Bro
Any at all
So do any Fridays or Saturdays work for u Casey
Obvi
I'm trying to joinnankther leag
Any at all
Do any Friday or Saturday work for u casey
U

Sid
Damn
@Casey LaPointe yo Casey are u able to draft at 9pm on the 27th
Is one of the days he listed
The 27th
Ok
Ok. One of Casey's listed dates is a tuesday
At any time at all during the weekday
Is there any weekday draft which works for u guys?
@Siddharth Bhaduri
@Kartik Hegde
@Neil Nijhawan
@Chris Chan
Yo Chris does any time during weekdays work for u for draft?
What changed his mind
And what he say
Does Wilbert for sure not want to play?
Like u said u were going to do
Find out your September schedule in the meantime @Casey LaPointe
Typing
With the time u justbspent
U could have said yes or no
You said 27th and 28th work right @Casey LaPointe
Do weekdays work for any of yall
Y'all got ur dude
For what day is best
Why do i have to wait for everyone to respond
This is bullshit dufe
What were the other agreed upon days
9/1 in the morning doesn't work
List the days asap
Ok casey
I'm sorry
That's just far from. That
Sure. How is that equivalent to "if the person doesn't pay Eric doesn't get his refund"
This is ridiculous
You keep changing shit mab
It was never made explicit tho
That's all I agreed to
I found the person
I never agreed to this
But that's not the same
U did
Not that last paet
Plz quote
Where that was ever stated
Quote
Plz
The dude is found
Like this was never agreed upon
Now its not just that another person is found. Now he has to pay before I get my money too
This is ridiculous
To this shit matt
Why do u keep adding stipulations
When I was trolling lol
There's not way that not a single day is compatible
Why would u suspend payment until then
Bro they're going to find some draft date that works for u
@Casey LaPointe
Ok 8/26
He said 9/1 in morning
Worked for casey
Yo 9/1
Just pick one of those days that matched up with everyone else's choice
Anyone remember
I'm too lazy to look
What days did Casey say he could
Y'all need to find a draft day pronto
Let me go look at what days he put down befoee
That d be very helpful
50$
Ok. Are u able to pay the buy in today?
What days can u draft casey
*
ð»

For anything
Especially as it concerns my fate
These polls are void
You might want to rethink that matt
For literally any poll

U see what kind of voters are voting in these polls Matt lol
Somewhere

"Wathcing u suffer is better"
If he doesn't sound evil
Listen to this dude lol
Lol
Youd rather deny me my refund than have me leave

Id have been gone for a few weeks
Idk why u didn't just let me get my refund then lol mike

This yr
Im setting a tone early
Central
6 pm
Be ready
Solved
Draft tomorrow
That business
U gon get that work this yr mike
Nah eff that right sid
You're voting eligibility status has been compromised
The loony bin will hereby suspend all of your waiver activity until further hearing
You've just been accused of treason mike
With nothing short of the steepest punitive penalties to be enacted
If u go against this motion the loony government will consider it a treasonous act
In view of Sunday august 5th
And I hereby declare imminent draft
As runner up I am legally delegated the power of autonomously declaring an imminent draft. This right was granted me by amendment 45.6 in the loony bin constitution.
Idc what ur schedules are
Real talk
Sunday
And this is all support for my thesis
I presume there will be many forthcoming throws into this box
At the very least lets throw this game in the box of "preseason games which don't matter with respect to relevant fantasy scouting"
At most that's what we garnered from that game
Nothing
That y'all are postponing this draft for
What really did that preseason game give us
So what did preseasons first game show us gentleman?

Did we get too see role hints by j Howard? Cohen? Allen Robinson?

Alex Collins? Crabtree?
Extra mayo lol
Do it for the good of the league
Wilson
Penny
I..Intel?
They don't know what we know mo
Hand it over if u high test
Settle it right now
Duh
Ya
I'm genuinely concerned
Will he get touches taken by Dion Lewis?
How good will derrick Henry be
Imma try and get him round 6 or 7
Ya
Espn doesn't have d wat going till at least round 7
Not targeting d wat earlier than round 5 at earliest I bet
People aren't going to be targeting him
But
Trust
I was the one getting those lol
I know for I rostered him
Ya
Most likely
Ya because he will still be available later tho
Lol
What
Lol
No doubt
Im getting d wat this yr
5th or 6th at earliest
Ya
To go 4th round
Is he that good?
On espn
Overall player
Ya j Gordon is ranked 35
Top 5 wr
Will be a stud
Davante adams
Z
I like him
Ya
Ya if they blow people out
Lol 6 is your conclusion right
What about tyreek hill
Z has strong feelings about a lot of players lol
Lol
U want ertz again z?
What's jeffreys ceiling this yr anyway
Lol jeffrey
I'm gonna be first pick tho
What about Watkins on chiefs?
Is Brandon cooks on rams viable?
?
Is golden tate a good wr2
?
Golden tate anyone
Lol
Adam thielen?
Hilton
What about t.y. hiltom
Lol
Do u like Doug Baldwin z
What kind of receivers does z want
All
Of a
Zs draft might be most interesting
Lol
Why z
Lol
Zs squad is bound to be hilarious
Wow
Wow
Perfect
Lol
Watch
Its gonna be ivan
Lol
These were stored in the loony confidential closet
Mo why are u giving away all secrets
Get on one knee and start clapping
Tho
I doubt it th
Spicy
Chris going obj
U don't know how to do thay
Lol
I watched most of their games
For the chiefs in their playoff run too
He was clutch
Dude late season and fantasy playoffs hunt ate
He's a stud
In telling u
Were godly
His early and late performances
He only regressed mid yr
Dude
What u looking at
Are best in league
His stats for 3 of those games
What....
If he was still there
Ya maybe
If I keep 7
And that's what I would go
Id go hunt over kamara
He good
Led league in yards last yr
He's fine tho
Lol
Idts
?
Are people going to be drafting cook over hunt at 9 as well
And Fournette is rather high at 4
If I'm 7 I'm not going kamara
Lol
Go ab
Go dj z
If u want ab over your top rb Kartik why don't u just take ab lol
Or if ab falls
Imma draft him at 7
How far is dj falling
Who would i trade kartik
At 3
Who's Matt going
At 5
Or is mike
At 6
Are u really going Barkley sid
True well get some judgment
But well see
Doubtful
Because of that
Penny is slightly risky
Ya
Or will Carson dip into it
This yr
Is penny getting a good worload
His hype is sufficient to draft him round 1
He might be
Do it
Ya low tier
Wr
He's low tier we1
Better
Nobody will have a beyterwr2
He's best in league
Nah if u can manage to get him wr2
3
He had 3 tds...
First round or second round honestly
He's not worth
If he's last years version
Jilio
Or 2016 nulio
Is he going to be last yr julio
Idk. How good is Julio going to be
U weren't supposed to tell him neil
The rest of your team better be solid tho
Ya those are decent given two strong receivers
And ya
Nearly as fun as football
Its so fun
Do any of y'all do fantasy baseball
My squad heats up in playoff push mike
I told you imma outhit u come years end
Look to my squad the last two weeks
U want to see real batting mike
Ya playing don't mean nothing
J howard
Lol
We is
Yup
That would be funny af
Loool
He could drop to 10
So
I'm not drafting kamara at 7
Lol potentially
Is definitely your best choice
Elliot
Barkley is pretty high. But not #2 high
Bell is behind Elliot and Gurley for me
At 2
Go kamara
I mean I personally wouldn't but then again who's asking me right @Mike Vacala
Lol
That's a huge chunk
Ewww
So Neil would get 1 11 29 and then 49.. That gap between 29 and 49...
With that
A lot of depth
You have depth
He would effectively tip over
Neil would have a very heavy top end but a quite weak bottom
It might not be that bad
Actually
So I can laugh at ur team
I want u to
Do that
Lol gl with that neil
Of
That's starting to seem like that's all you're intellectually capable pf
Like stop ad hominemning lol
I really believe
To answer me sincerely
This kid is just too dumb
Most apt for u
Yours too
Group Bitch set the nickname for Mike Vacala to Dumbest kid in group.
Group Bitch cleared the nickname for Mike Vacala.
Like I said most of your questions are
If you TRULY want to know both who is going 2nd overall and further who else might be going Before u pick at 5th then why don't u vote for first round protected picks like I suggested?

I think its clear that u don't truly want to know otherwise you would in fact vote for my suggestion.

Since I don't believe u truly want to know then I can only assume that you're asking facetiouslyb
Now what
!!!
He chooses bell
Wowwww
Suppose he takes bell
Useful?
Is that info pleasant?
How do. Benefit from knowing whether Kartik will take bell or gurley
What insight will knowing whether bell or Gurley going 2nd give u. 

I really think you're just wasting your time asking tbh
By addressing what I say
That
Show me
No bite
Want to talk about all bark
Yet don't do anything about it
You just keep saying they are
U have yet to do that
Like show me that my claims are dismiss worthy
Then y'all ain't watching
If that isn't apparent by now
Lol you dismiss me because you're not smart enough to contend with me lol
Just pointing out inconsistencies
Talk about loony
Mike wants to know info yet doesn't vote for things which would give him said info
Mikes a hypocrite
Psh nah
And everything
Yhats cool
Cool man
U clearly want info now
If u don't choose either of those
Why u talking
Srsly tho
For real
If not just stop talking
If u want to know these things now either endorse my "first round protected pick suggestion " or vote to draft now
Why do u care lol
I agree
Ya
Only if the pair want to make it official
Ya obvi
If we did that matt
Can u manually change the order
Ok if we agree on swapping spots we have to mark it somewhere to make it official
One
Ya I called that immediately after Matt said u had a favorable ome
Give me like a few hours to think it over but its basically settled
Stop tweakin
We switching
Mo
Aintit
7 is perf
My 7th
Nah loonies keep trades in house
Most likely yes
Boa
Me
Right now
Gimme 1
Group Bitch changed vote to "8/12" in the poll: What day should we draft?
Honestly if y'all weren't lil chickens wed draft tonight
Group Bitch voted for "Tonight" in the poll: What day should we draft?
Group Bitch changed vote to "8/11" in the poll: What day should we draft?
So reveal pick order
He paid too
So he can vote
Someone invite mo
Group Bitch voted for "8/12" in the poll: What day should we draft?
And that's all we have to consider
Ez
I think the impact that the league would have because of trades in that one month window will be bigger than the impact that preseason yields for roles and injuries
But enough trades would happen to be significant
I can't speak for y'all that much
If I had one month
I guarantee i will have made 5 at least
Pshh
Y'all are chumps
I really want to see
In preseason
What pct of rosteravle players will get injured
And plea "injury injury"
Y'all just neglect trade time and waiver time perks
But seriously tho
Mo just paid btw
Timr
How is one week enough tomr
Yr
Last ur
I made trades for months
That's nothing
1 week...
I think what you get in trade time and waiver time would outweigh minor role and injury info
That'll significantly impact a player who is trade happy like me
That's almost a month gone for trades
I'm just trying to figure out why dudes like mike are so bent on after preseason
Like I'm sorry but
Plus waivers
Is the fact that we will be able to trade from now (supposing we were able to draft now) until the regular season starts not an easily admitted perk by anyone?

Does this trading ability outweigh the information gained from roles and injuries?

I don't think y'all are considering this
Im tired of working around your schedules
Y'all are weak
Let me leave this league
Man
For real
Are embarrasing
The excuses u people make
On your whole b day
U can't find an hour
Drafts take like an hour
Hours
Y'all act like drafts take 4 biurs
..
Oh shit
Bois
Boos
Mark your calendars boi

Mo

We get our 10th member
Today's the big day bois
U can*
Madden is lame. U 's exploit little gimmicks in it so much
Nope I finessed u
Ill blind trade u z
Psh maybe an icky David Johnson at most
Lol even Neil believes
Grrrr
They better be
Are these numbers official matt
He had 4 z
If he doesn't pay in the end it definitely won't be owing to that
That's silly
He's not going to not pay owing to a bad number
Who cares lol he's going to play
*
Advantage
Not saying*
Why would saying our numbers even give us an advance lol
Truth
7
What's ur number
I want it
2nd pick is lit
Say it
Yes
Nah
Lol
Step up
Lets trade
Neil what number u is
By ur reasoning
U should easily take that then right
Ill give u my 2nd and 3rd for u first theb
U don't think so?
For real
Who wants my first round. Someone give me their 2nd and 3rd
Lets trade
Ok mines 7 yall mikes is 5
My first round?
What are u looking for
If ur interested
Ill tell u
Z. Ill give u my second and third for ur first
Then I'm posing this to matt
First
For ur fies
Ill give u my 2nd and 3rd rounders
Srs tho who has a top 3 pick
And trade with me
Whoever is number one plz use that reasoning
Definitely lol
This is gonna be hilarious
Again
Im in same mock agaib
Hahaha
Mikes team was weak lol
Lets all reveal
Lol
All of a sudden I see "team vacala" picked
I know his numver
Hahah
Im in the same mock as u
Mike
Lolol
Wasting a spot
That way he would just be hurting himself
If someone breaks it just omit that member from gaining points for his player until he drops him
Simple
Ya
Last year was way too high est
For once
Lets be a high test league
Lets make it interesting
Nah
Rookies these days
Lol
Are u seeing this
Matt..
......
We need to strike high test deals in here
Someone strike a deal with me if y'all are high test
Two second and third round picks that person would have
That has to be enticing
For their 1st
What about 2nd and 3rd
Ill trade someone my 3rd and 4th picks for their 1st
For their 2nd
Ill trade someone my first pick
Ya lets trade picks
What's ur spot
Facts are the world sid
Facts
Because
So someone else speak up
From having the first pick
So we can rule out 3 ppl
Cuz he told us he's 3
And we know Matt's not first
Entailing he's not first
By "if nobody takes it ""before me""
And we know Sid doesnt
Tho
Matt insinuated that u dont
;)
Lets trade
Now
I want it
Who has 1
Barkley schmarkley
Mad dog plz tell me who u are picking
Matt
Or are u gonna do something about it
Are u gonna just sit there and take deens split this year
Ya but we were dumb lol
He ain't getting aj
So third he's low again
So that means second round he's high pick
Ya but the dude who's drafting Hopkins first round is obviously a low pick right
Greens late second
Those two and green would be incompatible
Given that he got those two
Greens gone by the time this person gets to third round
U funny aft mike
Lolol
Ya lol
Which one of those is being drafted first round lol
In your eyes?
Is cook a 2nd rounder?
This is gonna be hilarious to see who z picks this yr
Cook over McCoy?
All over the field
They have studs
How's its overrated
Srsly
Lol
Overrated
Psh
Lamar miller 4th
Fitzgerald third
D Watson second
Jags d first round
Which is exciting
We would just find out our first picks early
Everyone choose one dude in order of our current draft positions
Do
*
Mo
U like that no?
Lets to first round protected picks
First round protected pick?
U like that idea Sid?
That we will all draft first round
In the order of our current picks
Guy
We can each choose one giy
We should implement first round protected picks
Is your team gonna contain studs matt
No doubt
Tho
Hunt and bell were studs too thi
The 2017 fantasy football playoffs can be summarized in one word:Gurley
He played out his mind
And Gurley well
Andy Dalton was playing injured towards the end of the season and that greatly hampered my wr1 aj greens performance
Alston Jeffrey got pulled from the game early that week because the eagles wrapped their division and first rd bye in championship week
I had Seahawks d and by seasons end all 3 legion of boom members got hurt
So that was a dramatic production falloff
My qb big Ben didn't have a brown in the champinship
That's how dominant he was
He was on pace on points with bell and hunt for much of the season
Zuerlein
My kicker the best kicker by far in league got put on the DL the week of the championship
For my team
Injuries were a big reason
And his played one of his best
Week of seasok
My team played heir worst
No lol
U settle down
Lol
I didn't use the
Im a favorite nigga
I had the highest score game
I led in points for for a long time
My team was even better than that tho
Idiot
Chris was 7 and 7
That's why I named him that
Srs
Without him 1 and 5
With him he was 6 and 2
The best possible description of Neil's season is Elliot dependent
Im not familiar with an "obj"
Who's that
Cuz imma get him
Well then he's in the wrong
I pretend everything is all casual
Im a magician
See how I magically elicit confidential info out of people
When
Taken...by wheb
Are u drafting him Sid
True
Lol
Being a kelce guy
I see mad dog
Who's getting kelce this yr
You're a real piece of work u know that mad dog
What are we gonna do with u
Mad dog mad dog mad dog
So you're a savage huh ivan
I presumed you'd be
You're facetious like the rest of the non loonies are aren't u ivan
Why is that
In what way
Any topic he will be cooperative on really
And life in general
About fantasy
His beliefs
Elicit
Eleicit
Will it be used against u
In what way
In a few brief sentences
Who is Ivan zhou
Tell us a little about yourself
So Ivan
He's untouchable
I got elliot
Or keep it as pick order
Should we randomize claim order
Or something
Except maybe we could do first round claims only
Nah it wouldn't be different than drafting lol
Lol
Then it goes into snake
Order of last years standings gets to make claims first
?
I.. I do
I'm not sure if we can atm
Down if we could make rules
Kartik began talking about it
Why u asking me lol
Claimed
I got elliot
No but for real
Not just arbitrary claims
But there has to be rules
I'm down to do something like claiming
Big baby
Trade me baby
Not
Are u high test or nkt
Do u accept my trade or not Matt ****
Given that u know my spot do u accept
I'm going to need that from u
Matt u got 3
Do u have number one
3
2
1
Only if u tell me yours on 3
He's flexing on u mo
I..I want first pick
I want first pick
Nah but for real in this order
In order
Well have Neil reveal his
G..gulp
I would like to inquire about the rights to it
Plz
Whoever is the holder of the first spot step forward pl
I want to trade for it now
Ok who has first pick
I expect blockbusters
Let the trades occur early and often this yr
To a good fantasy football 2018
Here we go bois
Same
Stuff
U know your sfuff
That a way ivan
Lol mock with me mike
What do u want to do mike
Come get this l
Meet in middle
Hppr
Lol lemme get kartik
Cuz I got other suckere
Take him
Lol
U drafted Elliot knowing that
Nah but we all knew that tho neil
Matt
It could very well have vied for championship
Your team was strong
You were surely playoff bkund
It was really a shame to see ur best dude go down matt
I give u mad props
U were 2-0 against me last yr neil
I..I'm afraid as it concerns my pick I have a really.... Good one y'all are going down! I'm afraid for yall!
Mike is Kirk cousins a top 7 quarterback for u?
Ill say that much
Ivan hasn't made a good first impression
Wow!
You're first mo!
Lol
We don't tell Each other our picks but if u don't like yours there's a decent chance it could be better
How about we can do blind trading of picks
Srs
Ok for real tho i got first pick who wants it
Trading picks is innocent until proven guilty
My pick number is impeccable
What's yours mike lets trade
Yours
Ok what are all yourd
I'm open to it
Kartik
Quote where he said that
Whys it worst
Mo thinks 6 to 8
And may u rest in peace
So say your prayers now
Its over for all yall
I gotta be honest with ya fellas
Whod u go with at 4 Neil
I'm gonna lose this lesgue
Damn
Is it bad that I got 4th pick yall
No that's dumb lol
Matt's concern is dumb
Mo will play with any pick
Each others
Lets all reveal
I was thinking I had the best pick
Weird
Now that I know mine
Nah its game over for yall
Face it
I'm the best this league has seen
What u about ivan
Speak upboa
Ya where u at @Ivan Zhou
Is he reverse phsyclogying us
Lol
The information we would gain
That could easily offset
If we start earlier we have more time to trade
None of y'all have addressed that
If u ask me
That's significant
Longer time for teades
Trades
Etc
For bye weeks
Prepare
Modify
Not only admire
I am
Matt
I am
But not that overall it will be significant
Again I acknowledge that "SOME" information will contribute to "SOME" players
What was the ceiling on those players
Is
For someone who i wrong
Lol classic defense mechanism
Get it ?
You asked me where u said "no" or "none".

I responded: " when you said "don't believe any".

Saying that someone "doesn't believe any" is semanticAlly equivalent to saying "so you believe there doesn't exist a case where information would have significant effect on player?"

Which is equivalent to "no cases"  or "none".
Do u agree
Respond to what I just said
Yet
Yer
My answer was in. Degrees
Yer
"Don't believe any" = none. 

You're asking if I believe that there is "no" information which would be significant. 

That's an all or nothing request from you.
What are u saying m8
And what u said wasn't in degrees lol
Said
I was speaking about what u saud
In that thing u just quoted
Did u go to work drunk lol
Are u crazy bro
"A vast majority"
Mine was in degrees tho
Lol on the basic interpretation of that question you're asking for an all or nothing answer
Yes and to a vast majority of those it will not have a significant effect
Players as in NFL players
It will not
To our teams on the whole
I said to some players it has a significant affect
Answer one at a time
Does it not
"You don't believe any" = none
Do y'all understand if so help me out
Who else understands
Someone else restate it lol
More clearly
Can someone else explain what Chris wants
What do u mean
There might be individual pieces which are significant for a player here or there. But on the whole the information will not be significant as it affects a teams general outcomes
True
Im waiting for u to begin lol
Lol
Doesn't have any equals none
"Any"
Whether i think it has nonelol
Or asking me
Why do u keep saying that I think it has none
I said it had minor lol
Something Like that
I would say that article didn't aware me of hunts role changing at all. I'm pretty sure hunts bio during the draft last yr read "he might play second fiddle to ware early on but he has the talent to earn his share of the workload"
More for sure
For the entirety of the nfl
For the players that we will be rostering minor
That's what I've been arguing lol
Minor
Definitely
Yes
Last yr
As high as he was rated in projections
U know that right
Lol U cited an article which said he "secured a spot as rb#2 behind ware"
Until I am
So
I mean I haven't been shown any from prior preseason
Is what ill put it at
Minor
Correct
5th round
Highly
Hence why he was drafted pretty nightly
That was known lol
Or multiple
Until u cite a better game than u did
True but preseason didn't exactly put him on map
Worthy
Until u can cite something else
Ya but notbing in his preseason performance showed that
Chris drafted him 5 or 6 rd
He was projected by espn to be pretty good already
Hunt had 11 touches 63 yards . that's nothing to show any more than we knew
I can cite a bunch of dudes who had minimal impact in regular season who did good in preseason too
Rod smith 21 touches 89 yards preseason week 1 2017
I haven't yet
Ill watch vid
Ok
Or at least useful
Those aren't exactly numbers more information is gained from
What about this game. 11 touches 63 yards
Where preseason showed this
Link game
Link
^^^^
Bet
Lol
Find me some and ill say after preseason is fair
Which were indicative of regular season success
Were there preseason breakouts last yr
Lol right..
The status of basically anyone u could name  isnt worth waiting on
But that person will probably shift throughout the year
Whoever is used for the important snaps in a given game will get the big points
They'll have high ceilings low floors
Recntly
They've been doing that for a lot of years
I'm pretty confident the packers are very open to using a comittee
Crabtree is a flex
Like what is there to know
He's the raiders wr2
He's flex worthy
I'm pretty aware of Nelson role
And ill agree
Come up with 10 compelling cases
Then ill agree
Large
And if the list truly comes up to big learge
Come up with them all then
So the fact that u could generate an example
If anything I counted it as a border case. I already admitted that there are at least some cases where it would matter. I just claimed it would be a minority
In your example
What exactly occurred with Russell and fly nn
On some grounds or other
I recall dismissing that
I ask
In info
What is there to gain
How much u wanna bet
The perception on their role won't change
A vast majority
Most players roles will be known
That's the best way I can demonstrate its insignificance
That's the best way I can put it^
The only advantage someone would gain would come in the very minor role changes which will be seen in a very small proportion of the rostered players
Burdens on earliest speaker
You claimed significance first
Its very minor
The significance is so debatable
With respect to injuries incurred how does u being a better scout apply?
Until further treatment
Well lets not treat it as something to be seriously considered then
What's a probabilistic State
Where is the advantage
How can something be an advantage if every member gets it
All members will either be with or without the information in either case
This
Like the advantage that u think yours getting is offset by the fact that everyone gets thkd
There is no advantage to waiting tho. Everyone is at equal odds of drafting a player who sustains injury or player whose role increases or decreases unexpectedly.

Each member gets an advantage. But that just amounts to it being equal playing grounds in both cases (before preseason or after preseason)
I say
As to the former
There are two factors which(argued by you guys) us drafting after preseason will favor: more info about roles and injuries
U know what question I follow this up with right
Why doesn't it work for u
Be reasonable
Mike
That doesn't work for u mimr
Lets do two Saturdays from nkw
Unless u think they won't agree
Why are u asking then
U know u want to
Choose to draft sooner mike
Howard is yours
By all means
Plz
I better see it reflect ed in your draft
Okpick him as such then
That's a large reason why I don't like him
I can never tell if Neil's being sincere or trolling
I only fuck with facts
That's nonsense
U don't think he'll be right mike
He's definitely not
...
Ill easily take that
Bet lol
I think Howard might fall to 3rd or 4th this yr
You're #2 at least
That's rules
U gotta reveal it z
Again
Before u flunk this season
Get yo head in the game z
Or something
U want a cookie
Idk what u want z
He had most points for best record and championship
Yet u talked a bunch
I didn't see u anywhere z
Exhibit A
He walked right on to the championship
Lol what
Lolol
I'm coming for z baby's squad!
Lol
Them
He dropped then
For the last two messages
Oh wrong chat lol
This is the first time this year all my pitchers are healthy
Robert if u can survive the pitching onslaught that's coming to u this week you truly will be the best
I was like mike spent a large portion of his time scouting and following. There's no way he could just drop all his players and not regret it at least a little
Mo and I knew your holdout wouldn't last lol
If you're still trying ill make it fair
Because ill just prevent him from getting points unless he drops him if u want
Are u trying still?
Lol should I tell Robert to drop markakis and hader for u mike
I'm a big dog y'all some cats
What do i even bark about lol
The things about which I bark are definitely things in which my bite is quite strong
You're toast in this league too
This week and when I play u
Your team was toast
Lol U lucky u quit baseball mike
I just didn't see the contradiction
We have unfinished business
From what I said
Was derived
Explain how #2
Sid
Anyway sif
He doesn't merely love him. His fantasy success  is contingent on him
Because you're botching  it
Or just don't bring it up
Whole arg ment
Screenshit
Yes I did
Yes sid
It was "Given a bunch of other relevant info, 2 plus two equals 5"
It wasn't a bare 2 plus 2 equals 5
Lol burdens on u
See what I'm saying
Remember that
That u don't give fullncontext
This
About u doing thus
What I said
Recall
Lol Matt
Wait you're not
You're right
That's true
Show me the "if then" statement
Given that
How is number 2 agreed upon
Sid
How does that follow
Y all  clearly can't dispatch me very swiftly
#2
Of those statements
Where do I even insinuate the second
Wait
*
On
Obviously
They're true
One different senses
Me or Chris
Lol who's really the first one to quit talking
This should have happened yesterday
To find another
Because there's no more burden
Cool.  Give me my money then
Sid don't begrudge me
Sid chris
I'm waiting
Address what we were talking  about bois
Your sense of humor is coarse if u think anything he said is funny lol
What does that even mean lol
Y'all  just change subject
Who is really the first to stop talking lol
Did I address it when I replied to Chris pictures
Rewrite it
What's the contradiction u speak of sid
Defend yourself
Cmon
No chris
Why does that make u laugh
Everything is quantifiable is the same as to say "you can always define it such that it is quantifiable"
Matt
Exactly
As it is
I don't understand it
Rewrite that
To quote Wittgenstein
I have to use my ladder then throw it away
But I have to argue to show u
That's my whole point
Don't
For the very reasons I proposed
Arguments are futile
Precisely
Thesis
That's exactly my thesid
That's how it is
Exactly
If u define then In such a way that they can't be quantified then yes I agree they cant
Think*
You think of finding truth like hitting a target Sid.  

You clearly thin I'm missing and you're hitting that target.

In reality nobody can miss the target. We're right based on how were defining the terms
Nothing more to it
If u aren't then they can
If you're defining "Love, infinity, etc" such that they can't be quantified then they cant
I was defining it that way
There's nothing of substance were arguing
I'll give it to u straight. Either you're defining "love" in such a way that it's necessarily not quantifiable or you aren't.
The reductio went out of fashion
I got news for u sid
He thinks hes slick
Isn't he
Hes trying to reductio me
U know about this mike
Lolol the reductio
Whispers to Matt* "i get people here every time in philosophy "
Or how else would u be able to say that
If you can diagnose it is far from accurate you must have some sense of it No?
Or Why u asking me
So u already have an idea in mind then?
What's a non crude quantification
What u mean
That it is
Showed u
Sid
I just quantified
What u talking about lol
I stop talking
Love is the number of instances one kisses another
Lol. These other views aren't defended well
Not that they do
I think they should
For u
Want me to quantify it
Yes
U don't know That yet?
Everything is quantifiable sid
So I would say it's quantifiable in a sense
Someone could tally instances of it and degrees to which it is removed from the most fair intentions someone could have in a given case if they wanted sid
Lol why
That's why
You're more inclined than most to lobby for outcomes which are neither fair nor in line with aggregate league happiness
No doubt
On par with the worst of them kartik
Biased enough to where it would affect their good league member standing
"Everyone is biased towards something. That doesn't count as being or not being a good league member".


Hence why I said "Very biased" lol
Or what does that mean
The picks
So are u reshuffling
For believing
That's sufficient reason
I've already said this
Lol he gets paid for his job on Wednesday
It's all yours
If he doesn't
50
I'll give u my 59
That's point one of contention
We do tho
So u explain to me why we should wait sid
Made me less serious
Thought
But more fboight
I was serious
Do u think Matt's modified paragraph is fair?
Even that^
Answer me sincerely
Sid
Don't be facetious sif
You'd be a corrupt man
If u do then I'm not sure your vote should count on any of these polls
Do u think its fair for Matt to withhold my money when I want to leave a month before season and have someone play with my funds for free?
Sid
Let me ask u this sif
And generally just not good league members
Y'all are very biased. Very facetious
The votes are foregone conclusions before they even start
I already said it lol
You guys are trolls
I don't want to be a part of it
Ok. So get me out of this league with my money back then
The most possible
Its very possible right now
We aren't agreeing over the meaning of that clearly ^^
"Soon as possible"
So I don't see the reason to wait
Tbh
I'm as confident in him paying up as any of u
I already wagered my 50
He's going to pay up
I think that's childish
Why should we wait a few days lol
A fair one
This is a simple ultimatun
Now gimme my money or continue on with me knowing my pick
With the exaggeration lol
Stop it
Psh
It
Acting like  couldn't lower kt
Like gtfo
Of paying each one back
And ill assume the burden
Send me all the money Matt in one payment
Y'all can lower it
K well
Do u want me to screen shot forum post
I tried lok
Lol
Mad dog
Pathetic
Matt dog
For this being patheti
Blame matt
Slighted
If I wasn't being sligtef
I wouldn't threaten anything lol
Matt won't give me my money back
And ultimatum
Lol U serious. Do u know the context of this threat
So if u withhold upon request I deem that stealing
U would
So ya
This
Like tbis
To any terms
I never agreed
If u did that matt
You'd be effectively stealing my money
Y'all are done
Im 2nd pick bois
Because there will be an excess of non loonies otherwise
Matt has to morph into a loony this yr tho
Down
Who's in
Lets draft two Sundays from now
Low-key
Lemme know my pick number in pms matt
Nah
Lol
I like this league already
Nice way to be transparent matt
Ignorant of*
Adding to the suspense notion that Neil mentioned
That way each participant will be ignorant to his fellow participants positions
To allow pick order to be revealed individually to each participant
I entreat u
Peers
Of most people not knowing
For the sake
Well let the happen
Nah
That would make it better
That way nobody knows other peoples
U reveal to everyone individually
How about
W..what'd I get
Shit
Lol
I won't tell him
I want dean to play lol
Until they pay don't reveal
That's a good idea
Lol reveal it to only Thsoe who pay
Lol share it with me
Lol
He'll pay lets just find out pick order
W..why not
So lets find out pick order
I'm confident he'll pay
That's what ill put on the line
And I won't get to play
That's fair isn't it
Matt how about u spot mo and if mo doesn't pay on Wednesday u can take my 50
So u better get that snake mo to pay
No I will not
No
Are we replacing mo
How's the search coming bois
U ought to get on finding someone sid
So if it really is sad
I'm staying
If y'all find 2 more by tomorrow and do pick order reveal
Has mike?
Have all the members of this league helped in the recruiting process
?
Matt u have tommy d on Facebook
So I can ditch this phony league
Me too
Gets
Well see what hits it vets
I posted a thread on yahoo fantasy football forum
U should be good
Y'all said u have a few in mind
Ill lobby them
Give me the contact info of the few y'all have in mind
I don't claim its easy
Compared to how much time is left and the point at which I made the payment I wasted an insignificant amount of timr
Time
I wasted next to no timr
Then pay everyone back 20$
So what
And sure I voted for 50
Why would I read the debates
Stay on topic
How's that relevant matt
Hardly any wasted time
That's nothing
I paid like less than a week ago
The season starts in a month and a week
Its well before the threshold should be applied
Its arbitrary
What's the threshold
If I quit a second after paying did I waste ur time
Time
To wasted timr
I just gave u a reductio
With what
But y'all ain't man enough to justify those votes
Y'all voted
And then ill concede
Someone step up and give some solid arguments
Comments like that are a huge reason
I really don't want to be in here
Honestly Just give me my money you're making a show out of this
But I don't think you'd be able
I would ask u for justification matt
K make pick order happen tomorrow
Them
Message then ahorita
Who are the eligible candidates for 10th spot
I would spot dean but I only have cash
I make some reasonable requests which will preserve the integrity of the loony bin
Refund me
K well
Is that feasible?
Inviite they by tomorrow
That's why I said
Reveal them all
Ok that's fine. Pick order tomorrow and I'm good
1
That's necesaary for pick order
By tomorrow
Someobody find this 10th
If not I want out
Ill be a happy camper
Reveal pick order tomorrow matt
No love lost
Nobody will have to dupe anybody or scramble for anything
And this league will remain intact
Those are simple requests
Well I only want go stay on 2 conditions: draft within next 7 days or find out pick order within 24hours
Do u have any other candidates
How do y'all expect to fill the other spot if I stay
Stay
If we find our pick order now ill sgau
Now give me refund
I recruited mo bois
Pay up mo
Good
This is a joke
For time wasted
Like what's the threshold
Like if I sent u my money and then a minute later asked for it back would I still have wasted ur tkmr
Explain to me why I should find a replacement plz
Can't even trust this dude
Sigh. Why did I send u my money...
Why am I wasting my time with this. Just give me my money lol
Why would u let them play on my money
Y'all are out of luck
A random
I don't think I could convince
Honestly
He's not paying me tho
Ill find one willing
Y'all got to figure that out
I'm not having him pay me
Bro
Can I find a random
I don't think it will be successful tho
And ill still try
I tried
I don't deem that unfair
I said I would try lol
If its unbiased sure
Trust
He wouldn't want that for himself
Which he very well knows will not be objective
He took a vote
Just take this case here
ð»
Ill try to find  replacement matt
He consents to things which if he was the beneficiary of, he wouldn't consent to
Enough
He doesn't put himself in the shoes of others
Matt applies the golden rule sparingly
Choose one
Matt and fair
And we obvi know my feelings for non loonies
I don't even like the loonies lol
Mikes outburst certainly contributed to it
To the subject
What changed is the extra thought given
^
I did Matt. And I gave it more thought and decided it wasn't worth dealing with
Because of the mentality of most of the members
That's not an optimal experience
It will be spiteful voting
It will be mob mentality voting
It will be very biased and without justification on the behalf of the voters
Every vote and even further every convo  that will occur henceforth in this chat will mirror the vote for my refund
That's a clear exception because u expect that person to be reasonable with u
I hope I can
I think I can
When its a person u know fairly well
And this isn't a tournament where the holder of funds is someone I don't know or have influence over
If there is nothing stating "no refunds" then probably
Not even close
But I'm not
Don't let me have refund
I would agree
That's why I said if I was trying to do this very close to season
Can't get into another league in time..
Then u give us all our money back lol
So what
Even if it did
Cept that I wanted draft to come sooner
Shows nothing
*
UndedicTed
It clearly doesn't tho because I'm trying to leave hence uneducated
How lol
I though it might expedite the draft date at most
No point really
If I have the money
From doing it now or later
I just didn't see a difference
I'm not sure honestly
I absolutely did not know that
Especially 1 month before season
Absolutely not
That I couldn't get a refund
Which were what?
Ya feel
Reasonable
U can't fight unreasonable with resomableb
That's what happens
Lol when you're doing an injustice to me
But still very biased
Only less sketchy than mo
Matt's as biased as they come
Far from truth
Why is Matt commissioner in the first place lol. He thinks he's this fair just commissioner
That's all that goes on
Read pms Matt enough fooling around in here
For favor
Ok. Send my money matt
Not sure why Matt did that
From the trolls
Did we expect anything else than a unanimous no
Send me off with a proper refund and ill be on my way
Y'all are only tolerable on that condition
Only condition I stay on is if we draft tomorrow
That's what u did
Almost every word u type neil
Chief reason
Because y'all are trolls
Its that I cant
Its not that I won't
My wasting didn't affect much
Y'all still have ample time
Well it won't happen again
Didn't work
I tried finding a replacmeent
Idk what u want me to fo
Address what I'm saying
So stop with that silliness
You're not going to touch me
U have to at least run them by your mjnd
To yourself
How do u rationalize the claims that I bring against u
But show it to the chat
Do it for yoursef
It really is
Embarrassing
Instead of just dismissing everything
Forrl once
Use your mental powers
Then
Show it to us
He immediately resorted to violence
Hence why he didn't address anything I said
Mike can't handle the truth
We have exhibit a^^ right here
Wanna talk about getting emotional
Calm down
Lol U wouldn't do shit to me
Stop calling u out why?
Character
U are highly emotional chat
U need to calm down lol
Very vulgar character
I clearly said my intention was other than to provoke a fight. Yet mike encourages that. Just add another instance to mike being "vulgar" notion
It must be very wide
What is your scope for talking shit
Does that fall under talking shit
True
I'm criticizing your personality
Define that
Shit
Talking shkt
Lolol
He's talking like a crazy man
Is mike drunk right now lol
Than his ability to fight
Because his intellect is far more important to his well being
A savage undertaking
That's a savage concern
Why is fighting being brought up
With his speech
Lol mike keeps substantiating my claims
To try and better them
Others
I criticize him and othwer
What does being a negative dude mean
Mike does this to a gross amount of subjects
The word "silly" will probably be used
He's going to say something complete dismissive
Lol
He has a lot of prejudices
Mike doesn't ask the important questions
Reflect on your statements more and to a greater degree of scrutiny
Assume less in your judgments
Ask more questions
One way is to be less presumptuous
If it doesn't pass before his mind will he ever attempt to work on it? Maybe incidently but not intentionally
^
It's not sufficient to do that obviously. But its almost necessary if he doesn't believe so himself
.....
How do u figure I don't think he's slow
What do u mean
By drawing it to the attention of himself and everyone else
^^^^
Pointing out a weakness so he can correct it
In*
Unlike mo
I think he has the potential to get better
To make someone change
Same reason that y'all drop players on baseball
I think he would do very poorly if I gave him lsat questions
That's what he's slow at
You could give mike a paragraph of information and he might be slower than average at drawing the proper inferences therefrom
He's fast in the sense that he's very presumptuous. He presumes things very quickly. 

But he presumes wrongly an inordinate amount of times. 

He's slow at drawing correct inferences
Does he tho lol
What is common sense
What does that meab
I think if he had asked me I would have responded inn the affirmative
And I have to say
He asked that
Srs
Are
Like mentally slow
Supposedly he asked bz yesterday "do u think I'm slow at all?"
I feel like I'm interacting with an actual retard
Worse
He will only make this league arose
Honestly I don't want mike in here
I've ever seen
This dude makes the most emotional decisions
He plays the part so much more naturally
I hand my job over
The dude is the president of loony tunes
I can't tell reiterate enough how disagreeable this mike vacala fellow is
Ill hold u to that
Ok
Y not
Whoever wants number 1 ill sponsor them
Forget that ill vote for u personally to get pick #1
Vote to draft soon then neil
Mo
Lets just keep ml
Wait don't we only have to replace 2
Ya lets get 3 people
Very decent
You're a decent man
I like u chris
Minus redundant of*
I want to be able to both admire and strategize for my roster for as long as possible. I'm willing to sacrifice my knowledge of and comfortability with of snake drafts for longer time to understand and tweak my team
That's the only way I consent
I'm down to do auction if we do it within the next week
Commissioners seem to inevitably get first pick
Is espn gonna automatically make u first pick again matt
ð»
U down to find out draft order today z
What about u neil
First
Supposing u chose firsy
What spot would u take
If u had to choose z
Oh
How are u sure of that
W..why have people voted otherwise then lol
For me
But y'all can choose it
Lol obvi
Why what
Ill do anything anything
Plz Matt I'm begging u
Lets establish it now
Give it to me
Whatever spot you all vote is most inferior
I'm willing to take any spot you give me as long as u let me know now
If u let me know now id be very cool with that
^
Maybe it can be manually done
I still think last years standings should choose in that order
Whoever this hypothetical person is
They can have another
Shit give me last pick
Should we have just bare votes or justification for votes
Matt
Mat
Teams know well in advance
In the NFL draft it isn't decided 1 hour before lol
It would easily be more pleasant knowing ahead of time
At least not in this case
The suspense doesn't make it more fun tho.
Group Bitch voted for "Today" in the poll: Draft order determined Tonight or 1 hour before.
Oh
U vote today Matt?
The suspense
Lol
Would we be able to find out today?
You're right
I do have strong feelings about that
Lets find out draft order asap
He didn't do anything
I looked
In commisoner
Dude
You're off the leash at this point
What's gotten into u lol
Omg
Ur crazy bro
Calm dowb
I checked
He gave me commissioner powers
He didn't do that
Win
How did he give himself the wib
Doing what
Stop being presumptuous
He didn't cheat lol
I think that would be even more fun
As well
Is anyone interested in a league where we can draft individual defensive players
Y'all are on the one hand fighting for insurance and on the other encouraging the membership of a prime dude who would prompt us to have to apply the insurance policy
That's an indication of impending lack of devotion/effort/interest
That's already a red flag
"
He responded to your initial invitations with "only if I co manage
In*
Has his lack of interest not clearly been exhibited on your minds?
That's only going to enable sabotage and the like
Why do u guys continue to lobby a clearly uninterested player
My schedule seems to be only the people I've played once
What he change
Did he mike
That sounds right
Simple
The amount of insurance needed to prevent is more than I'm willing to pay
More down ya
That's correct
And I want the pot to remain the same
That's why
I don't have the disposable money to up the insurance
And no i don't want to up the insurance
I really don't believe dudes who have bad records will be any more inventivized to try with a 20 dollar get your money back thing
Best
Keep everything
20 ain't gonna stop any afkers
Like Cmon now
U think people care about getting their 20 back
How are they inferior
I don't agree to that
But nobody agreed to that
I understood that
Pot would remain
No shit if we increased by in
That
But I'm not forntha
No shit
Not shit
Given thag
Well ya
Like I said...
....... So the overall pot would be decreased....
How does the insurance aid incentive?
In what sense
The rest do
Who cares if they don't care
By doing what
Add points to player who dropped
Subtract points from anyone picking up players who someone dropped out of sabotage
Commissioner can do what I proposed
Why do we need insurance
Chris
Lol u like using that word don't u chrid
As otherwise ?
So first place second and third all win same amount?
Is that correct
As I understand it the pot would be decreased
Perhaps I just don't understand your formula
Lol emotion
So
We have ways around sabotage which won't sabotage our winnings total
Or we could just do no insurance
It isnt
So no
Lol I'm basically commissioner
And its not happening
You're not funny
I'm not sure why u keep saying this stuff mike
I want my big pot
No need for insurance
Ok then do that
So they aren't tempted to pick them up
Beforehand
And let everyone know this
With
And add the points that person would have gotten 38th the players intact
If anyone picks them up just subtract those points
Easy fix
Same
Like mo
Now you're going crazy commish
Lets just keep everything
I don't understand. Does winner and runner up and 3rd still get same amount?
Going today*
What pitchers did u have today matt
I honestly want to destroy his ass
He's just not commisioner
Nah let mo stay
Back
And let Matt get them vack
Or u can stop being a bitch
Ill just tell mo to subtract all points they accrue
I'm not sure why u would even try
Anyway
Matt's picking them up
Lol stop
If u didn't leave like an emotional girl you'd know
Plz
Matt pick up your players
Having mo as president was actually a terrible idea
We can't be having irrational league presidents man
Dude
He kinda does
Lolol
That's for noobs
He gives tips we already are well aware of
Lol that's a waste of a read
I protest
Nope
Ya he says he's paying next Wednesday
Cheers v
ð»
U really got me stumped this time
Gee mad dog
Or give a time frame
Like at least say yes or no
Not only has Matt asked several times. But I've private messaged him. Mike has told him.
Hes ignored everything
Question
Fuckin
The
Answer
Bro
^
ð»
That's why I Remmeber
I copped all his dudes
Ya lol
Ew
Right now
Lets pick a draft date
Lets do it for real
Same lol
I decided against mocks
Nah
For not wanting to
Y'all some pussies
Lets draft august first
Lets wait lol
Fantasy baseball league this yr
Mo does tho
I don't actually know him irl tho
Waiting to see if he's willing to pay
Lol
I might have someone boys hold the phones
Inv him then
Ya they must be a natural loony fit
Who would be a fit for the loony squad
U got anyone Sid?
True
An invested random
Maybe we should just recruit a random
U got the funniest screenshots ill give u that matt
Lolol
Pretty much
When he's left
And mike many times
Him too
Exactly
Lolol
Srsly lol
That I would invite
That leaves out a lot of potential people
A lot of people wouldn't be suitable for this environment tho. This is a toxic environment. Fragile dudes will break in here
Ya I'm going to try
Lol
This is the loony bin after all
Than those chumps
We need someone more reliable
Em
Fuck am all
Fuck Vince
Fuck pepke
Nah fuck Jean
Hm
We do need another loony tho
For whatever reason
Most of them don't like fantasy football
Do we have a 10th yet?
Did mo pay yet
May the best fantasizer win
Good luck this year gentleman
Payment incoming
K
But its not working
I would just facebook pay u
Never done it
How does it work exactly
Do u havechase quick pay matt
Me
Almost everyone we played with knew more about football than mr
That was my first year in fantasy football too btw
At least as I'm understanding your conclusions
I'm not sure what to say mike other than that your conclusions don't follow from your premises
Yet u otherwise acknowledge it to be an inferior metric to points for
You're always consulting record when its convenient for your image mike
The satisfaction aintbthe same
Winning it without the warriors ain't the same
Been*
Like when LeBron wins the league he has to be like "well obviously it would have significantly more difficult with the warriors in my way"
That's like taking the warriors out of the nba
Srs
That would have to be in the back of your minds
Even if y'all had successful seasons next year without us wouldn't it be in the back of your minds "Damn my team is good but would it have been good enough to beat Eric or mo?"
Imagine replacing the championship teams
Sucka
Let me check the luster meter in light of our replacment.

*checks*

Yup it's lacking
To say the least
Lackluster
That would make this league...
If mo and i were replaced
I plan to pay asap
Yes I will
Yes
My uncle has told me this riddle since I was like 10 btw lol
A subtraction and an addition would be incorrect for the same value.

Either both subtract or both add
Very simple
U would subtract 3 and then subtract two with respect to the value of money accounted for.

With respect to money paid u would start with 25 and add 3 then add 2
U wouldn't both subtract 3 and add 2
This riddle tries to confuse u by equivocating the two
There are two values to be aware of: how much they paid and how much money is accounted for
The equation this riddle wants u to believe: 30-3+2=29.

But subtracting 3 doesn't make sense
10x3 =30.

-5 =25.

+3= 28

+2=30.
Saying that they paid 9 each obviously doesn't account for the pocketed 2$
This riddle wants to make it seem like only 3 was taken away from their initial payment but really 5 was
Saying that "they paid 9 each" is misleading since 5 was subtracted not 3
They would have only paid 8, 8, and 9 respectively
And I've solved the riddle bois!
Each
Given that the dude pocketed 2 they didn't pay 9 eaxh
That's the catch
Lol cept they didn't pay 9 each
"Sorry but we can not include that last part in your offer" -management
Lets see if your fantasy baseball skill transfers
Use your own team this yr v
Group Bitch voted for "yes" in the poll: Kick the new guy out?
That's loony speak for what mad dog said
Sksvrklr alrneai rbrlwcui eoqndb
Dammit mad dog
Who's down
Lets do it in a couple hours
Don't u ever block me!
All that bark but we know Kartiks a cat
You can never tie mo down.. That's facts
That'd be fun
Draft
Yo lets do a loony mock
Just gonna win it back*
So really mo and I should be exempt from having to pay. Were gonna just it back and more in the end. Its just a mere formality at this point
Whos winning this league matt
Ya ill pay in next few days
From either of u
Deal
Again
And cop all your good players agaib
Imma give u that 128 to 60 whooping like last time
U ain't gonna want none of my squad
Imma beat u down this year z
I agree tho. U gotta pay up mo
How did we split "my"winnings
We both won..
Split my winnings
If you drafted the rbs and wrs of RB1 elliot, RB2 Jordan Howard,
Wr1 davante Adams Wr2 Demaryious Thomas are y'all happy with your draft?
Right now
Who's tryna mock draft with me and mo
Kartik who?
LOL
I'm trying to body Kartik man coverage
We out here neil
That was an instance
Just recall semifinals
I'm sure you've caught plenty of Ls in your time
If you're trying to catch this L this season kartik
Ya know
So really what are u
I destroyed you in post season
Not smart
You're not funny
Face it
You're not appealing kartik
I really believe he would fail
I wonder if Kartik could legitimately get anyone else besides his goons to laugh at his jokes
I couldn't care less about that
I'm far more concerned with the truth and being a good person than whether anyone likes me
Anyone else?
That's eerily something like a bench warmer would say
Kartiks a bench warmer as you can probably already guess
But I suppose the members in this chat could benefit from its wisdom too
So no not here
It was meant for a sophisticAted chat
You ever been that way with anything ?
I take action
When opportunities arise
I'm a truth seeker kartik
Sike
Already smoked one today ayyy
because i merely defended his reasoning a few times
The non loonies inferred poorly that me and pep were besties LOL
Its because I'm actively in pursuit of truth people
When I defend people why is every one inferring that it's because I have some affinity for the person whom I am defending lol
That's basically what Mike did
Lol
So far it doesn't seem so at all
I just don't think what you're saying is well thought out
Because I do that all the time with grays clothes. But it has nothing to do with being untrustworthy
He never intended to give them back?
^^^
What does that have to do with trustworthiness
What has mo done recently that has demonstrated that to u z
Wow
Ww
Lol
Team mike getting that pipe this yr
It is positively better off
On
The league will and must move kn
Least points against was the thing which kept him afloat
Mike was
7th in points for
They got exceedingly lucky last year
His team wasn't going far anyway
That's all this is
Its my duty to improve others morally
With many instances lately*
The ban should be observed
On those grounds alone
If that was sincerely your reasoning the accusations don't even have to stem from you being unreasonable grounds. Just add that Saturday to you "being a lame" grounds a category which has been saturated with instances recently
What is bullshit about it
That emotion is being exhibited
I'm laughing at it currently yes
His only day off
Like what 24 year old says that on a Saturday
"Rest of the day to myself". Are you a overworked 45 year old mother with 2 children now?
What are u like a fiend lol
The fuck
Like Cmon now
When I suggested alternative ways of me getting back home I asked " so you didn't intend to play any sports today or leave your house at all? You planned to sit in your basement all day"

"Yup"
You wanted to preserve your pride
You discovered bz wasn't coming back to get me.

Your mood immediately changed to the point where you weren't willing to do things which you normally would do "go play sports" just to keep your pride. Not conceding to go drop me off even if it was in the form of meeting bz halfway at some basketball court to play sports was a means to maintaining the appearance of not being weak.
U ready
My psych sense is very apt
Let me give my psychological analysis of that situation
Drizzled at that
It rained for 30 minutes all day
You
I will only formalize if your ensure me that you will give a formal response
The most negative person u know
If by negative u mean "inclined to find the truth" yes I'm very negative
You've got things twisted
Emotional... About what lol
Very easily
Demonstrate it to me then
I..it won't happen again gulp
Sorry I had to resort to this
The dude leaves every chat I try to take it to
Maybe this isn't the jury I wanted
Shit
Then matt comes in with these kind of comments
Now*
Nah you're being a hindrance to progress Chris. If not a hindrance at least not a help
I want a jury to give their opinion on this
You left the other chat in which I could bring this up
Or..
Hypocrisy?
Yet... What are u doing
You don't like when your mom dodges your accusations do u
Far
I have to say
You're not from from them
U like sounding like that
You sound like Everyones mom including yours
You're the obstacle to progress as it stands
I'm trying to make progress like Chris mentioned
I..i don't see it
Who in here is being negative
Me?
?
Why are these accusations bullshit
That's the very least you could do
At least explain why its bullshit
Like a bitch...AGAIN
The dude leaves
Lolol
Guilty of all charges
Those are the words of a truly unreasonable fellow. We have our verdict boys
Mount a defense
Do u deny these accusations
The accusations in question: you were an unreasonable emotional disagreeable dude on Saturday
Whenever someone brings up false accusations on me I immediately address them. 

So either two things are occurring in your case: you either think the accusations are true or you are unwilling to address them.

Either way reflects poorly on your character
Acquits*
And acquire himself of all charges
A noble man faces his accusers
That's not the dismissal of a noble man
Finish it For me matt
Thus...
You don't dismiss these claims swiftly
If u had the ability you would be able to dismiss these claims swiftly
I think its a matter of ability rather than you thinking its not worth
Or no?
If its bullshit then it should be ez to counter?
But you're all about giving bullshit
Many times
You've spoken on it mo
He flees the kitchen
But when the heat is brought to him
He's all about giving heat to people
When the heat comes his way
How many times has this dude left chats
Like a little bitch
Lol mike just runs from criticism
Get in here mo
Lol what u mean
Anyone else?
I'm looking to draft august 1st
Look it up
He committed the fallacy of false dichotomy didn't he mo
Cough!
Shut up just shut up!
What's mike
None of this preseason chatter means nothing anyway
Im finna win this league so
Hm
Bulls got jabari?
Vote for hppr then
Its like a standings which shuffles every week based on who's leading in stats
No. They could be points based.
Standard is scoring type
H2h is matchup type
Lol
Standard is the scoring type not the matchup type
For real
Lol
I call a spade a spade ya know
Lol
Give me ninth
Certainly
Kartik will be competitive certainlyb
Tbh
I see it being me mike mo and Sid rounding it out
I like how u think already  mad dog
Who are your preseason picks for playoffs sid
Imo
30 isn't even worth
Matt?
Z who are your ideal (but still within reason of drafting limitations) 2 rbs and wrs
Your team taking it all this year baby?
Group Bitch voted for "50" in the poll: Buy in.
Lets do 50
I suggested 50
Ya
Thus only developments before week 1 matter
Developments which affect both drafts aren't reasons why one is inferor to other
That's why week 1 is the only relevant week here
@Chris Chan
And that's what y'all were arguing was it not?
The developments which occur after week 1 will affect both before preseason draft and after preseason draft. Thus they aren't reasons why before pre season draft is inferior
I highly doubt that
Will u be starting him lol
Starting on any of your teams *
On any of your team's
I can't wait to look at the rosters opening day and see not a single player who was in a position competition
Do it then
Not because u think its the best possible start
U would only start him to get the 100
Or anyone who comes out of the jets qb race
And that none of us will
I will bet 100 dollars u don't start darnold
Not week 1 if none of us are starting them they dont
Just irrelevant to week 1. They could gain relevance in later weeks. But drafting after preseason would also enable us to see this later relevance
And that's highly likely
Thus not consequential
I'm BasicAlly saying that any qbs in competitions will mot be among the 10 which our 10 teams are starting on opening day
It*
And thus less likely to have high touch shares
Given the fact they're in competitions
Its likely to be so tho isn't I chris
How many times I have to say this?
Because the qbs or slot receivers who are in those precarious positions will either not be drafted at all or be drafted so late that they will hardly affect our teams success
And u think preseason will reveal this to us mike
I gotta reiterate
Times
How many tiens
The differences between the draft dates are either inconsequential or we all have to deal with them
How
U think preseason will alter his role
What about him
Name one
I already addressed this
Like I said. Any players of whose roles we are unsure are almost assuredly not going to be drafted. If they are they will be bench players
I already addressed unknowns
Chris other than unknowns im not sure what your argument was
If it happened on first play of regular season
And adjust ur roster
To react
It would give u less time
In fact
Not with respect to How It affects your team it isnt
You're in same predicament
Were all taking same chance mike. Suppose he got hurt on first play of regular season
Now someone respond to this^
There will be unknowns true Chris. I claim all the unknowns will either not affect the outcomes of our seasons, or if they will every one of us has the same chance of being negatively affected
Formally
Restate any of mos or chris' arguments
Cam anyone in this entire chat
I don't want to straw man u
I want to understand your argument as clearly as possible so I'm not attacking a different one u don't actually hold
So I don't talk past u
State what u said formally
I've literally offered counters to every ones points
And y'all are saying its unnecessary to conceal the fact
I don't think any of y'all are able
It really isn't tho
Ok. Write it formally then
Are u equal to the task?
The same task I assigned mo
Formalize them then
Mike
How did i lose
I.. I lost
He will be sharing touches with 3 Other very capable dudes
Even the person who makes it out of that committee on top will not be optimal to have at flex
That isn't a player who fits my description.
So no neil
If the dude who is competing with all of them is any of your flex I pity u
Browns
The dude who is competing amidst hyde, duke Johnson and crowell
Would Chubb be your flex mike
I don't consider him such a player
Lol if Chubb is starting on any of your rosters I feel bad
Or who will be competing come preseason
Name a single rb who would be a rb1 rb2 or flex who is competing
Them
Name then
Willing to sacrifice it
I'm willing to forego that info ya know
Like I don't care about the info I would receive from pre-season depth charts decisions when its my last player on my bench
Last yr or any year
Can y'all name a single person who was in a position race who was drafted highly
Thus not important to ones success
The person in the competition would be a bench player for sure
At least not very highly if at all
My argument is that anyone who is in such a clear position race wouldn't be drafted
Honest
Lets be honesg
Who drafted Matt Flynn that year anyway
I'm willing to bet not a single qb that will be drafted this year will be in such a qb competition
And they should have accordingly tlstayed away
If anyone was decently informed they would have known that the hawks qb race was murky that year
I mean I would probably counter with something like did anyone choose either Flynn or Wilson in that years draft anyway? Was anyone trying to get involved in a murky qb race anyway?
That's a fair example
Did they really?
Somekne state if very clearly
What's the point
My roster consisted of Matt Ryan. Hyde. A brown. Cooks. What did i need to find out about them lol
Before pre season who was the favorite to be starting running back for Seahawks and did it change after ?
And was anything actually altered in the Seahawks depth chart chris
I was highly invested yes
What u mean chris
Starters?
It was a figment of our imaginations at most
I don't even recall it being the slightest
You can't share what u found out last yr
Other than injuries
Do y'all?
I don't recall finding out a single useful fact last year
What are we really going to find out in preseason
Idk
But is it enough to surmount the desire to draft now
I like that
There u go
That's a fair point
Hm
Either way
But nobody is getting that here
Well I mean in reality I would want an advantage
If not then no
I said only if everyone else has an advantage with respect to info if i didn't scout him
I already responded to such a question
Probably not
Does that mean its in his best interst
Like jimmy prefers slaughtering his family
Ya know?
Who gives a fuck about your preferences if they aren't in your best interest
I.e.. Whether its in our best interest
Shouldn't we be questioning whether we ought to
This is hard I know
So u must add on to mere knowledge of player performance and injuries
Before it will suffice to say that we "ought to draft after pre season "
There are many other factors needed to be taken into account
That's nowhere near sufficient
Not even close
U think the antecedent entails the conclusion as it stands
That's what your current argument looks like
All u have right now is "if we have knowledge of players and injuries then we ought to draft after pre season "
Recall the intended consequent is "therefore we ought to draft after pre season"
Ok. Where's your consequent
How tight it is
And well judge
Rewrite it with the consequent in there
Rewrite your antecedent
Yours wasn't very tight
There has to be a very tight connection between antecedent and consequent
So try it again
Because as it stands that conclusion didnt follow from your antecedent
In order for it to follow that we ought to draft after pre season
You gonna need a longer antecedent
I don't see how your consequent was entailrd
So what u have said so far didn't entail that
The consequent of your argument is supposed to read "therefore we ought to draft after preaseaon"
Because your argument is complex
This will be much tougher tho
See how easy it was
In this form plz
Now put your argument
There u go
Or give exAmple
I love how mo says yes he knows what modus ponens is yet he doesn't describe it
But u gotta overcome this one
Are tough for u
I know intellectual tasks like these
Its all u then
Ok mo
For my sake
State them in modus ponens form matt
This chump is too ignorant
U formalize them
Yes matt
U can try right
But
I know you're not very smart
Can u please formalize
Blank therefore blank
If blank then blank
If, then form
In modus ponens forn
In waiting for formal reasons
Usually people provide reasons for their actions right
You keep saying right or wrong
U serious
LOL
If u do
Give a basic example
Inb4 he's looking it up right now
Plz
Give an exMple
What is it
Answer me this real talk
Do u know what a modus ponens is mo
Hold on before we get into this
Satisfactory justification
Majority rule with justification
About its outcome
Yet i said I don't give a fuck
You keep referencing the poll
Without justifying
Why are u still talking
Care
I don't c
If everyone is on the same playing field with respect to info then no
I only want that info if everyone else is getting that info
Of course its about right or wrong
Who cares what the poll shows. Im not interested in confirmation. Just justification
The most basic argument form
You're almost 24 and u can't modus ponens
Its about time at your age u learned how to do it
For real tho
Modus ponens or shut your vulgar mouth
@mo
Why are u still talking
Bet u can't lol
Formulate an argument for that one too
Damn
You graduated and u can't even formulate an argument
Its really embarrassing u can't do this
Modus ponens me or google
Google
Bud
No more
Otherwise stop talking
If u don't know that hat is
Go Google it
Modus ponens plz
I don't think ur capable
Formulate your argument then
Changes
With respect to fairness nothing chances
*
In pre season
And then u have to scramble
If anything knowing that dudes get hurt in regular season will give u more time to trade for someone else in stead of them gettin hurt week 1
But we all have risk
Just as if none of us had chance to scout
Y'all getting the chance to scout will have everyone on equal footing
I'm confused
Every one will be at the same disadvantage
What do y'all not get
Every one will have the same opportunitie to scout
And formalize something that looks like "if blank, then blank, blank so blank"
Stop talking
I don't yet understand it
Formalize your argument for me bud
In theory every one has equal chance of getting hurt
But nobody will have an advantage over anyone else
You're gonna have to put up a solid argument for this one
Ya. That sounds more optimal. Does Sunday work for everyone?
Lets do it tomorrow night
When are u free
Sometime this week then
Fate will do its part
If everyone's taking the same risk who cares
For any of you making that excuse I say: won't you acknowledge that every one is taking that same risk by drafting before preseason
The chief excuse I hear from people wanting to draft today is "I don't want to draft and then have my players get hurt in preseason. The less time there is for them to get hurt before the stats actually start counting (regular season) the less risky drafting is. Therefore we should draft a few days before regular season"
Well alright. Lets draft today fellas
He likes it
How u know
U making the playoffs this yr mad dog?
It was me vs him in the championship
Team abdellatif
Why u say that mad dog
He's a double agent
Mad dog is posing as a loyal loony when in reality he's colluding with non loonies
The rumors that
But are the rumors true mad dog
Its true mad dog
U either affiliated with loony or non loony or ur a nobody
This is a partisan league sid
Lol
Its a position that comes with a lot of responsibility
You'll be replacing mike as vice president loony mad dog
I like mad dog. I vote him loony
Dog
Plz dont
Are u gonna auto draft this year mad sog
Vince isn't even playing anymore
Ya lol
Lets draft tomorrow
Damn
Lolol
Sounds like a bunch of bots
Lol what kind of league
How bad was this league
With an auto draft team lol
Did u make playoffs
Shit wrong chat
Yo mad dog.. Lets.. Uhh lets collude
Lol
Did Sid go to uiuc
Lol I had more acquisitions than mike interestingly yet mikes associated more with waivers than me lol
On waivers
Who did u pick up
Lol
And was the league ppr or standard
Of what players did your team consist last yr Sid
Whatup sid
Loo
Lol I've seen him on recommended friends befoee
I'm confused is Matt a loony or a non loony. He's got this weird trans idenity going on
Lol
What was my score our second matchup
I would be very pleased if u could reveal it to the chat
I'm still waiting for our h2h record chris
So I can get an easy division win
Let me in a division with Chris kartik and neil
Causing me to have to shuffle a lot
It really was
My draft was poor
Will u do us a favor
What was our h2h chris
Can u state it for the chat
Chris
What was my record against u cheis
What's ur evidence kartik
Clealey not enough to make playoffs
Not your outcome
My opinion concerned your effort
How does that invalidate anything
Someone verify for me the pct of those transactions which were kickers or defenses
I could just counter with: you could have had more points
Chris
What do these facts have to do with the argument at hand cheis
One more time kartik
Its very near
Chris
Add it up for me cheis
Those basically don't count
If y'all will check the facts a good 70% of his pickups were rotating defenses or rotating kickers
Trying and trying very hard are different
That's not what I said
Those are real numbers
No way
Screen shot
How many did i have
Idk
(Insert generic excuse)
Creeping in girls closets
Y..you're a weirdo
Because that would obviously matter
Same amount of spots?
Is it parallel to ours
Ok. What is their format for rosters
Cuz
That impression must've been derived from a tenuous source then
Standard ya know
About 10 seems optimal
No. That few of teams is obviously bad
W..we just gave an alternative reason why 12 is bad
To look at
They will be unaesthetic at the least
12 team league?
Down
So that didn't help
Rather h2h is with all of them
H2h, hppr, auction, ppr. These are all still compatible lol
Hm*?
I'm?
And everyone has a right to uncensored speech here in loony bin. Even the most loony of em
For we have all done our share of talking
But letting him talk is only fair
We all know that
Who said anything about elections
Inv him back
We all do
Lol u shit talk about fantasy all the time
True true. And you demand that we do hppr right
Y'all down for 50 each
What's the buy in this year bois
For the record
Deen would vote for hppr if he were here
Is my vote
Lets draft today
You would rather let it go random then control your pick when you're up 3rd?
Format
Gormat
U should desire this
U get to choose 3rd kartik
I think that's fair
In other words first place chooses first 2nd place 2nd etc
Should last years standings get to choose the order?
So
That the championship is all mine this year
I just wanna let u know
Deen
Matt
Add him
That team would be best in league
Seriously
Lol
Be*
The rookie rbs are gonna best studs this yr just like last years class of kamara hunt cook and Fournette
You*
I know you're high on penny this year aren't h chris
Thats the real question of this years draft
Which one of y'all is gonna be bold enough to take Barkley 1st round
Lol u would have made playoffs if that didn't happen
What receivers are u high on this yr kartik
I think anywhere from 4th to 7th pick is ideal
Going in the first segment kind of sucks because although u get someone elite u have to settle with someone pretty good late 2nd rd
8th to 10 u get someone still really good and then get another really good on ur back to back
5th to 7th u still get someone very near elite but also u get a semi early 2nd rd pick
First 3 or 4 picks u get an elite rb
Ight. Honestly I see perks of picking at almost every position.
What u mean
Manually randomize
Do u think its better than snake?
Ill let the commish take that one
But i don't envy first pick so
Ya
Have u done auction before kartik
U crazy
Lol entire team matt
Nah the standings order should pick where they want to draft
He's the. new addition.
Bz
Lol
^
Group Bitch voted for "HPPR (Half point per reception)" in the poll: Points format?
I like hppr. I was gonna suggest it before u did
And David Johnson
lol
When are we looking to draft y'all?
Are those real fish
If we boot the incumbent champion from our league well look like cowards
Lol I agree
Renew the league
When's this years draft Matt
Russ definitely proved me wrong last year. I was one of his doubters for sure
I think*
We might as well just forego this league altogether becayse: it think it is blatantly obvious that I will come away victor of this league
We still have to go over the finer details but id like to think its been generally established
Ain't that right z
I'm zachs new personal assistant
Yes I do!
Its nut up or shut up in this league!
Down
Where only the best fantasy minds reside
The 2nd year of the exclusive loony bin league
Are u in for fantasy football 2018 z?
Group Bitch added Zach Freundt.
I'm pleased to announce a new addition to the loony bin league: big buff bz
Lololol
Thought he was ahead of the game
He's just an idiot
Ya he was lol
Pep and Vince for sure out
Whyd u say 4 mike
I'm pretty sure
Zachs still in tho
Vince and pepke
down
did mo ever have intentions to be commissioner?
^^^^
if u so high on him
ok u better draft him in fantasy then
r me and u showing up in the chip again next yr?
and i know im pumped for fantasy football again
have the easiest road
wow d wat and the texans
ya
2 to 3 u think?
hmm
hes gonna be a fantasy powerhouse
dude jimmy graham on pack now
to see pack haave hardest
but its definitely interesting
from hardest to weakest*
the hardest to the median is only a 39 pt difference. that seems kinda insignificant
so its not that significant
its less than 100
from hardest to lowest the pt differential isnt even largge
What a spiteful lil bitch
And now hes authorizing that my shit get vetoed without justification
Lol im in this fantasy baseball league with Vince and he carried over the bitter feelings he got from us vetoing a lot of his shit into this baseball league
Ur going down anyway!
Whats it matter#
Lol
u call him yet?
yo whats kevin palmers email mo
i have matts
i have yours
i need ppls emails
matt cant draft tomorrow
matts in
^
Lol true
Crabtree cut from raiders
At this rate id believe it tho. So many additions and subtractions to teams
I dont see it on espn
Did it
That didnt happen
interesting very interesting
wow jordy nelson to raiders
he just accepted a deal with browns
the browns are slowly stacking
now carlos hydes a brown
are the browns suddenly like an attractive team to go to lol
For u rostered him
U of all ppl should recognize his talents
Lol he just had 10 tds last yr. Tops in the league for tight ends and wrs
leggo
jimmy graham to packers
wow realy
saints eagles vikes gonna be in the next 3 nfc championships at least
they almost a sure lock for nfc championship again
ya i know lol
crazy stuff goin on
wow
keenum to broncos
allen robinson to bears
wtf
kirk cousins to minnesota?
And matt pays winner
Everyone pay matt 10
10 dollar buy in?
So r we doing this
Yoo.
We should all just create brackets and join the same group on espn
Wow shermans a 49er
Only above z baby
Whats that??? I cant hear u all the way down there at 9th in "points for"
Sat in our free agent pool all.yr
He was becoming virtually fantasy worthless anyway
^
Whatd zack do
Thank u
Youve really made a difference in mikes life
i think its more likely that he plays better this year and the next few than most if not all college qbs could do if they drafted them in that same span
That was hilarious
Lolol
Eagles nationnn
Too much time
Ya lol
Pats gettin another late game tight end td catch called back
Ya JT is lame
Eaglesssss natioonn
Top 5 prolly
Dude jeffrey was one of thr best wrs this yr including playoffs

Eaglesnation flying high tonight
Cousins might go to broncos reports are saying
Whats gonna happrn to kirk cousins
Wow
Lol
Group Bitch added Mike Vacala.
Thats mah boi
Wow jeffrey dominated yesterday
Why is it so difficult to buy into foles
Hes close to top 10 maybe in bottom half of top 10
Once all those dude are healthy theyre gonna have a  Nasty wr group
The jags next yr are gonna be so replete with wrs its not even gonna be funny. As neil is well aware allen robinson went down very early in the yr. Then they had both allen hurns and marquise lee both of whom did well when they played but struggled with injuries themsleves. Then they had keelan cole and dede westbrook step in and do very well
Is lit
Game*
This steelers fame
zachs got the reverse hacks goin on
and zachs points for number lololol
wtf
except for mikes very deviant point against number
like you can draw a pretty regular line of best fit aronud most of the data points in this whole chart
why is mikes score against peculiarly low
..... so mikes hacking....
also z mike already predicted that like mid season
with last 2 comments
definitely disagree
definitely disagree
And jags arent particularly fun either
Bills are terrible to watch
Real game on next
That game was trash anyway
What happened
Ya crazy ending
I thought titans were toast
That game was really good
1st time ive ever seen that
Check the box score
Srs
Mariota just threw to himself for a td
Who yall got: titans or chiefs? Falcons or rams
Gurley and hopkins
I think gurley was just lighyears ahead of everyone
Ehh. Very debatable
The whole yr
The dude who backpacked u
Proud of gurley*
I wont allow dudes like chris and mo to get such stacked teams
My draft is gonna be so much better next yr
Mike Wallace coming today baby. He comin today

^

Big bennnn
Wow mo is roaring back
6 tds in last 4 games
Recently
Dude burkhead has been in god mode
Gurley td
Hurt u really bad
Dude those 3 rodgers picks
Lol jones put up 38 against the same team.hes playing thia week
Lets goo boiss
This steelers pats game about to be the best of the season
Ya prolly incomplete
Ya i think its incomplete
Woahh
Mo is back
Thats scary
If this games goes to ot
A rodgers is a miracle worker
Lol
Is lit
Wow this packers game
But not matt so much
I think chris deserves to brag
Why is matt getting so cocky. Hes having one good week
Is despicable
The bengals offense
If i make the championship aj green is gettimg benched
Turning the packers on
I cant watch this garbage
Im turning this game off
....
Kamara and ingram get hit behind the line every time
Is so fuckin bad
This blocking
Its because they either 3 and out immediately or turn it over
Dude
Anymore
My dudes arent doing anything
Is just stalling so hard
Dude this saints offense
Lol
When hes on my bench
Now olsen gets a td
Is so bad
This eagles defense tho
Srsly
Lolol
That championship is near
Wow my dudes are balling
Mos defense is getting shredded
Maybe next yr mo
Td
Ingram
Ya
Still buh bye mo
My dudes gonna get this td
Wow nevermind
Buh bye
Buh bye mo
Mikes dudes ballin
Wow
Hmm
Ya. My real life sympathies are with rodgers and the pack. But my fantasy sympathies are with kamara and saints
To watch the packers game or saints game.... Dilemmas dilemmas
Like a long ass time ago lol
Lol
To whom was mo responding
Mikes team isnt the product of faulty league rules and settings. Its a product of neglect on behalf of a lot of the members of this league
And let mike get whoever he wanted
Who literally did nothing on waivers for most of the year
But u had people like Vince Zach and pepke
And showed more concern
See that shit wouldnt have happened if some of the members of this fuckin league paid more attention
I remarked earlier this yr that it was impossible to build a team in moneyball fashion i.e. Through waivers. But mikes team is the embodiment of that
Rivers gettin butt raped
Omg
Lolol
Intercepted again
Has 2 tds. Almost 3 but they overturned one
Killing
Wow hunt is killiny
Hunter henry aint doing shit either
Step up
Rivers gettin shit on
Lets go kartik
Bout to get lit and watch it
This game tonight gonna be lit
Well see what julio does
If those dudes dont both post 15 plus i think i got mike
Idk i really think its gonna come down to the perormance of d hop and gurley
Both ur rbs. Mos qb and mikes wr
That packers carolina game gonna be huge for u both
Is fournette for sure out
This game
All i know is ebron almost had like 3 tds
What quarter
Not that i saw
Solid trade by me
Btw dez gonna outscore mjj for 3rd week in row
I watched whole game
No
This game?
Who had a td that didnt count?
Gtfo mike
My tight end had more pts than marvin jones
Yo fuckin daddy
Yall some fuckin lames man
How many pts is harrison putting up on u mo
Lets get after him bois
P rivers taking a beating today
lets go lets go
Lol whyd kartik start gore. His ceiling is so low
u take that back with all your heart
hey u take that back pep
Im that alpha in this league!
Him*
He had the 2nd lowest pts scored against u
How did pep only go 5 and 9
Neil please stand from your kneeling position
My dogs stepping up in the playoffs

the dude had 63 pass attemptps and 506 yds llast game
psh
over big ben
i was like "uhhh.. why"
on the waivers
lol did anyone notice chris picked up a defense
The glorious return
Week 15:The Return of A rodgers
if aynthing its way closer in wrs
wut...
show some love
cmon @Matt Wilfert
lolol
with a small weanie!
anyone else think mikes a meanie?
im coming for all yall squads
your optics are taking a hit
yall need better representation than that
what a weak showing
cmon non loonies. 1 person in teh playoffs?
why wont it let me add ppl back
Eric Alfonso added you.
is mo the killa that he makes himself out to be mike
u werent done talking ish were u @Mike Vacala
jesus
man we only got 5 for next yr
lol
matts kkicked
lol
and do ppr
lol i think we stick with 10
ya i agree lol
hes perfect
yesss
so true
hahahahahha
he bears the most ass team ive ever witnessed
how zach went 7-7 is beyong my comprehension
yall gonna need a whole army to stop the loonies
do u miss big ham @Matt Wilfert
whats sids full name
yall gonna need it
lol bring yo best competition
lol
i thought yo momma taught u better
get with the grammar ka@Kartik Hegde
lol "chris'.."
are the non loonies allowed in teh loony bin next yr. lets get a pre season judgement going
lolol
w..who u drafting next yr...@Matt Wilfert
lol
abysmal just abysmal
thats like 4 really good weeks worth
lol mo put up 400 more total pts this season than @Zach Freundt
gonna be the best of the yr
the pats steelers game this sunday
for that top seed
which is exactly the team agaisnt whom theyre fighting
they play the patriots next week
so ya
for home field
they def still want as high of a seed as possible
500 pass yds
i love it
this is looking real juicy for next week
big ben has thrown it 63 times and counting
that might be most all yr
450 yds passing
omg
the ravens
no big ben.... is just fuckin shredding
thats a shitty offense against an above avg defense too
someone tell me how in the fuck the bears posted 33 pts and 500 total yds on the bengals in cincy....
even the best ones
lol thats what im saying. so many defenes got fucked
.......
and there is still 9 mins to go
he has 52 pass attempts.....
big ben is poppin off
well would u look at that
almost every defense got smashed
if not i think this might be the first week
was there a defense in teh league in fantasy that had 20 plus pts?
every other game was quite high scoring
and the titans cardinals game
except in that shitty weather game
it seems like there was 0 defense this week
maybe the highest total score of any week
i dont feel like adding the numbers (although i probably will) but this week was high scoring as fuck around the NFL
.all that your team has managed, in the way of fantasy success above vince is less points against, which i again afraid isnt a virtue of your squad
lest i should be fooling myself
im afraid i cant entertain any criteria by which your squad is better
because its definitely not in consistency of poitns for vince has u beaten on that front
im eager to know ka@Kartik Hegde
what are the criteria by which you are pronouncing vinces squad trash and yours evidently above such prouncements
lol
thats just not right
how is there that big of a disparity
the fact that a qb can go from 24 pts to 30 pts to -3 pts should be illegal
but youd have to beat neils score by 28 anyway
he still might win
matt probably would have won
wow if wentz didnt get hurt....
unless his defense romps
actually matts prolly still losing
actualyl its gonna be hard for matt
and kartik loses
if mike loses
wait... both matt and sister can still make playoffs
interesting
wow graham has 0
has wentz outscored wilson
since that trade
1 of 4 weeks
u speak way too much before u think
u realize that wilson outscored wentz 3 of 4 weeks since that trade was made right @Neil Nijhawan
NFL is so random
i dont get it
or something like that
denver d had allowed the most passing tds since week 9
lol
hype *
kartkk is indeed still straight @Kartik Hegde
bell or bust?
elliot dependent?
corresponded*
weird. his 5 game losing streak almost exactly corresponed with elliots absence
im pretty sure coming into the season neil thought he was some fantasy mastermind lol
Group Bitch voted for "nah" in the poll: Everyone makes playoffs.
bud
sorry
u aint a big boi @Neil Nijhawan
lololol
i think the funniest quote of them all is neil's "playoffs r for big bois"
5 and 6 would be chris and @Neil Nijhawan
why do u even care
lol
idek why youre voting matt. you wouldnt even be in top 6
it hasnt resulted in any changes
my change of mind doesnt affect anything tho
complete corruption if we did
why would we ever reverse that now
matt earlier this yr said verbatim "if anyone disagrees i will not change it from 4 to 6"
tough luck
so many contradictions bois
cant change that now
SORRYYYY
welp someone disagreed
-@Matt Wilfert
i decided already saying if anyone disagrees, i can't change it
did I not repeat that like 6 times
lemme pull another quote matt u ready
neil when he was 4-1 "playoffs r for big bois"
lemme get your quote neil u ready
gtfo @Matt Wilfert
srs
this is fuckin embarassing
matt now "Zach think about how much more people will enjoy fantasy if we increase the #
The overall net pleasure
hahahahah
mattt when he was 4-1 "i think its the same amount of fun change or no change"
gimme a sec
i found some juicy stuff
omg
this gonna be funny
watch me pull out a lot of quotes
im actually going to look this up
to yall
this time i gotta say im sorry
sorry
u were like nah
but when u were 4-1
i literally used this exact line of argumetn in favor of doing this earlier this yr
so imma have to reciprocate
i requested this earlier in the yr and it got shot down
Group Bitch voted for "no" in the poll: 6 people make playoffs.
lol
way too many ez pickups
but they do
idk in what way they gotta change
srsly
lolol
what is this
hunt had 19..
wtf
davante adams had 20 pts....
uhh no no youre not
chris "im gonna win regardless"
unless u have a top 5 te theyre so fuckin unpredictable
sigh
of course cook scores a td when i drop him
3-1
i knew loonies were the superior squad
wow if scores hold its going to be me mike kartik and mo
mikes dominating right now
lol u need both kartik and mike to lose
this bengals defense looks like they dont want to be on the field at all
lol j ho is fuckin gutting me
hes so fuckin bad
nah. i bet it was embarrasing tho lol
even if the competition doesnt get worse
its crazy how some teams can look like absolute shit one week and then domiante the next
ya i agree lol
i think the browns might get their first win lol
gulp
i... im scared to play againts hopkins
is pounding ppl
mikes kicker
8 yd pass
ya a super short one
wow mo is killing sister
their offense is terrible
how are they in the playoff hunt
dude.. the raiders are sooo bad....
it actualyl might be good for rbs
not rbs tho
i think receivers are fucked
doyle and hilton
u have 2 of them dont u lol
u cant even see the players
ive never seen it that bad
no way
omg
omggg..... do yall see the weather at buffalo
kelce injured?
what happened
wow really
see theres kelce @Matt Wilfert
what d did u end up starting @Matt Wilfertt
lol its the 1st quarter
:(
my internet too slow
fuck im not gonna be able to watch any of these games
bengals prolly
lol
im destroying u
bout to be 8-0 after i beat u this week lol
lol yup. thats why my fantasy bball team 7-0
thats soo bad
lolol
20*
u havent had a qb score over 20l.....
yup
if u dont end up making playoffs its definitely on account of that
iirc i dont think so either
while starting?
have u had a qb score over 20 this yr?
i do admit that
true
lol
thats hardly enough time to judge for regression
u dropped him after like week 3...
u dont just drop mvps from 2 or 1 yr ago
i didnt drop matt ryan till like last week even tho i benched him a while earlier
idk what was going through your mind
lol idk why u ever dropped him
u dont even have anyone in those games do u?
those teams are lame af
panthers vikings is gonna be hella lame
what game should i watch!
u aint know nothing
stfu mo
lolol
or w.e. his name was
oh ya i liked shifley
that confused me
wtf
it wasnt shaffer lol
ya
i do remember
ohhhh
somone link a pic
i dont even remmber him
who was shaffer lol
just ewwww
murray and van alstein
peterson was chill
i liked peterson the most i think
i actually thought petty was decent at least in football
much
i didnt like murray
i kinda liked glass actually
van alstein was actually the worst of them all
extremely immature
they were all teenagers
thats a big reaosn why i quit
dude they were such weirdoss ol
ill tell my boi vince to get em all
then well have all the non playoff teams scoop them up since theyll be earliest on waivers
lolol
theres no way he wouldnt have given u something better
mike was in dire need of a qb
lol did u ever offer russell to mike?
shit i would have given u better
u could have gotten much better
lol matt that trade to vince, russell for coleman was soo dumb by u
lol only stacked because of dumby @Zach Freundt
youre up by 24 over @Kartik Hegde and 28 over @Matt Wilfert
ya probably
only if u beat both kartik and matt in pts if matt wins
because me and mo are locked
chris is gone
so with kartik adn mike wins and chris loss
kartik chris and mike are all 7 and 6
lol
what u mean? i just told u if he loses and kartik and mike win he wont get any spot
all chris needs to do is either win or if he loses he needs mike or kartik to lose
basically neil u need the most to happen
even if he loses
even if you win you most likely wont reach chris' pt total
u need to beat me. and have both kartik and mike lose and score more pts than kartik and matt assuming matt wins
no. if chris loses and kartik and mike win chris doesnt make it
of all 5 ppl fighting u have probbaly the toughest road
lol youre gonna need more than just me letting u win
mo and i got locks
5 ppl are fighitng for 2 spots basically
smith. hunt. hill. kelce. butker. crabtree. lynch
kc vs oakland has so many players on teams fighting for playoffs
what games should be watched tomorrow yall?
im not really excited for tomorrow as it pertains to the success of my team because I probably lost. But I am however excited to see who gets into playoffs
Bell
AB is a star
lol ya anyone can win really. if a situation occurs again where my best player goes down on the first drive then ya pretty much anyone can beat me
lol probably. but ur also probably not making playoffs
idk if u deserve to make the playoffs because of that absurd decision making
fool u once shame on the winston. fool u twice shame on the saints. fool u thrice youre just a retard
and what was the product?
ehh idk youre qb selection this yr has been poor. for some reason despite two of your qbs (winston and taylor) having gotten absolutely fucked by the saints defense, you decided to start matt ryan this week. who.... was again playing the saints defense
then you gotta look elsewhere
except for when the browns play a division opponent twice
true
lol
i did this for march madness last yr and it was fun af
we should do an NFL survivor pool next yr.

where each week everyone chooses an NFL team to win and that team can only be chosen once by that player. whoever makes it the farthest without their team picked that week losing, wins.
is going on
i was liike what in the actual fuck
i was watching gamecast last night and 3 plays in a row the screen updaated with this:

NO M. Ingram was hurt on the play

NO M. Thomas was hurt on the play

NO T Ginn Jr. was hurt on the play
literally like 10 saints players got hurt yesterday
now my 2 rbs
first the legion of boom
they have been fucking up my players
thursday night games should be banned
Splendid
Lolol both my rbs injured
:(*
:) ik
I havent really watched hunt play so idk
Tune in for the kamara show bois
This game tonight gonna be the best thursday game all yr
I purposely let him be in the waivers because i thought someone would assuredly grab him
Yall fugged up by not taking him.
I know lol. Hes a beast
Cmon kartik stop being mean
In his last 3 weeks
And look what happened
When i traded for him
Ben
Thats basically what yall said about big brn
..
When josh mccown stomps u this week neil. Dont complain to me about all the dudes being taken
Shame on yall. W.e. its gonna be to your detriment just like big ben was to matt
Wow none of yall grabbed mccown....
and he was relatively healthy for most of teh yr
hes sitting at 27 currently
the dude was projected to finish with 148 total fantasy pts
the bust of the yr award goes to terrell pryor s tho
lynch was kinda
but i never had high expectations for him anyway
i guess u could say crowell was
crabtree is a borderline bust
amari cooper was a bust
too*
no andrew luck no hilton
ty hilton should get added to. but hes in the same boat as jordy
demarco murray should also get added to the healthy but bust list
there were many busts
given that condition
i agree
true
llike rodgers and freeman and odell
and when some of those injured dudes were healthy they were dominating too
check our draft recap. almost all dudes in first 2 rds have performed very well barring injured dudes
but underperformeres i think you guys are exaggerating
ill accept the argument taht there were many overperformers
ya i agree @Chris Chan
idk if yall watched
odell played like god when he was in
check his games
freeman has been hurt for a while now
julio admitedly might be underperforming in the td department
hes top 5 in yards this yr
hes not doing that bad at all
this year
and julio iis prk 7
a rodgers is jordy nelson
jordy might as well have been injured
but injured players definitely arent busts
idk what definition of bust yall are using
why are u guys naming injured players
odell has been injured the whole yr lol
he did poorly
i agree
hes one on the list yes
compile it for me
make a list right now then
most dudes who were predicted to do well did well
i think you guys are exaggerating greatly
make a list of players who have underperformed according to analysts. i dont think its very long. some of the players u guys named were either injured for a stretch or actualyl still doing pretty well lol
thats why projections are dumb
kamara never been projected higher than him
thats been true for the entire year
lol when hunt is projected more than kamara this week ð
lol w..e that means
kartik needed the best performance of the yr to beat me
otherwise good luck
all i gotta say is anyone who plays me is gonna need to score at least 110 to beat me
your loss
u didnt trade brah
but all my shit was through trades
they are studs admittedly
i only got 2 of my current starters off waivers
this week
im probably gonna beat u by 60 plus
yours might as well be in the dumpster
lets not talk about trash teams @Neil Nijhawan
its like a draft basically. except not a snake draft but a standard draft
do u know how waiver priority works?
there were many dudes left
that isnt in conflict with what i said
ur point?
its true that mike usually got the best available running back each week. but there were so many more dudes to get
those are necessarily true otherwise you would have had much better waiver transactions
either 1 of 2 things occured in your thought process when u were 4-1 and 6-2 earlier in the season neil:

1. you thought ur starters were good enough that you didnt need waiver pickups.

2. you werent paying much attention
that we didnt get
left
there were so many dudes
that alone is telling^
gtfo
u hardly made waiver wire pickups... u had fuckin randall cobb on ur bench until like week 12
u prolyl thought u didnt need help
once u were 6-2
lets be honest
u just thought u team was good enough
u just werent aware
thats so untrue @Neil Nijhawan
And ya kamara is like only remarkable one
^
Except jags d
What waiver studs does mike have lol
Lol like who Neil
Neil- " all the studs came off waivers this yr" "mike has all the studs"
Youd keep your same vote?
Ok so if matt created a poll right now
Interesting
So now non loonies wanna omit the trade deadline
decent decent
aj green with 19 pts at half
Someone check
Idk
Wow ab in
Lets go lets go

Watch the big ben aj green show tonighy

Ur team needs jesus at this point neil
lol

BOOM Z BABY
Uh travis kelce?
Whats the fantasy outlook for tomorrow bois
Yet youre trying to get us to sympathize with u
Iirc u didnt pick up a single person in waivers this week
Dont complain to anyone
But ur bad
U could have gotten him off waivers just as mo did. U were before him in thr order
deeezzzzz
deeezzzzz
Youre a real class act neil
Solid
Solid
Kirk cousins with neg 3 at half
Cuz lets be real against z baby everyone has the latitude to take risks
Im starting dez bois here we go!
without IT
cavs have already won 9 in a row
*
year8
dude how much yall wanna bet IT and Lebron become a sick duo just like kyrie and bron were in their championship yer
prone to turnovers
not very accurate
immobile af
in truth
h...es not that good
U forgot to crop in my prks
But thats alright im gonna smash mike!
There was no hope
Once mike went to the dark side
There u go? Lol i already conceded
ill let my pts do the talking
ok well see
i cant wait to play u lol
good luck to u
w.e. mike youre gonna get smashed
w.e. i thought it would be more fun
oh then i guess its staying
lol wut
am i missing something
uhhhh
me-"yo fuck this trade deadline"

mike "^ i 2nd this"
and someone wake zach
and vince
idk if u read matt but i said we ought to get all 10 ppl
or
i cant tell if mikes just a dumby
come again?
u say no mike?
also i think we should have reasons listed for votes
lets get all 10 members in here for this
Group Bitch voted for "yes" in the poll: Should Trade Deadline be removed?
^^^
why not the fantasy consitution
the constitution of the us is liable to be amended ya?
against keeping trade deadline
so there goes non loonies argument
we already have a collusion prevention in place: vetoes
else
makes league more pleasant. why lse
this motion needs to be passed: trade deadline pushed back until start of playoffs
spell it out for me
i dont see it i really dont
america doesnt need more trolls plz
stop trolling plz. trolls are why trump is president
NEXTTTT
votes
ok well we know that at most that most recent poll will get 4 botes
we ought to implement that thing
if we get majority vote for anything
af
im game
idgaf
sounds good
easily
ok
what u mean it doesnt fix things
???
funny @Matt Wilfert
why wouldnt we take a vote
to vote
lets get vince and pep in here too
@Matt Wilfert
tahnk u
^
lets take a retrospective vote
nor should they be
they arent static
fuck the rules man. rules are made to be changed
the non loonies only rebuttal for getting rid of the trade deadline is "no we need to keep it to prevent collusion"

its like buddies what do yall think vetoes are for
lets take a poll. if more its tied or more votes are for keeping the deadline then well keep
their*
fuck these non loonies and there perverse opinions
why dont we democratize this league
lets take a poll on this shit
no trading makes fantasy way less fun
that should be the deadline
lets set it up until playoffs
this bs
im protesting
fuck this trade deadline
yo
Not just a beta! Even worse: a beta cuck!
Lol
Is we lucky kartik?
u do realize those are facts?
zach u do realize that u havent eclipsed 100 pts this yr right. and that ive breached that mark 6 of my last 7 weeks right?
well ur playing me so ya.
hold me to it
definitely lose. but prolly manage more pts than last week
my success pct is abnormally high
if yall want predictions for anything dont be afraid to ask
call me mr wall street
im like a stock genius @Matt Wilfert
matt do u remember when i told u "if your team was a stock im selling hard"?
^
so ya i think this chat would be better off
and fuckin useless
theyre all uninformative not funny
in here
just check your last 10 comments
do u even deserve to be in this chat
in ppr at least
wow
omg... since week 6 according to berry, kamara is the highest scoring player in fantasy football
wow just wow
omg alvin kamara is position rank 2......
Removal for retardation
Group Bitch removed Zach Freundt from the group.
Hes all mine off waivers
Josh gordon playing this week alert
Yall dont even know mikes boy perine
Welcomr back mike
Group Bitch added Mike Vacala.
Yall arent as bad as i thought after all
Ok kartik. Neil has 2 funny things said so far. There was ur first. Good job man
Lolol
I..guess not
I.. I was under the impression they were ubiquitously beneficial
Were looking to dump aj
Especially aj. Aj got into a skirmish with kamara earlier in the week
Theyre demanding new environments
My players are getting  restless. Theyre stagnating
Reverse this deadline matt. Its for the betterment of the league!
I want trades back and i want them back now!
So almost 11 -1
If i played all of mikes opponents id be 10-2. And one of those losses would have been by 1 pt
To be fair
His scores have been improving in recents weeks tho
If thats not lucky*
Thats a true stat btw
Idk what is
Now if thats lucky
Check this stat its crazy af. 8 of 12 weeks my opponents have scored 90 or more against me. Mikes opponents have only scored 90 or more 2 times
Better be*
Jimmies
But if he does make playoffs he betting be shaking in his jimmiew
Hes gotten pretty damn lucky his opponents play down to him
His scores are hella low
Tbh i dont think mikes in much of a position to talk shit. I gotta agree
Lol
Group Bitch voted for "efface" in the poll: Should we keep current trade deadline or efface it altogether?
Group Bitch created a poll: Should we keep current trade deadline or efface it altogether?
Lol
That
I agree with thay
True
Whos with me!
Let trades be yr round!
I vote undo it
Lets vote to undo trade deadline
Zachs idiocy is manifested so often that im starting to think its the standard not the exception
So whats the point
Even if ur just joking it isnt funny
I swear
Youre like 10 second tom??
Zach the fuckin trade deadline has passed
After drafting him 2nd overall
North shore deeply regrets trading a brown
Damn kartik gg. U prolly won. A brown too much for north shore
This dudr is a god
Dude omg
I wouldnt doubt it at this rate
Lolol
Jamal williams is a beast
Easily the best of today
Really good lol
Triple cover this man
They double cover him and he still scores. God damn
This some booty
Fuck man
Alright no more to brown
Bells cuts are sick
Cmon now
These interceptions tho
So im not the only one
Even cris collinsworth drew that comparison
U watching this?
He adopted some of his mechanics this week clearly
For some reason hundley is reminding me of rodgers
Look good af
Dude the packers
Dude is crap
Now i know why u dropped jared cook z
Such trash
He only had 7...
I had him starting up until like 30 mins before 12
I was soo close to starting mariota today
Thats just unacceptable
My te cant score 0 pts
So its fair
Lolol i know. But that was justice. Ingram and cook had tds called back
I need big ben to throw tds to everyone but brown
Gonna come down to the wire
Is soo fugin close
Omg mine and kartiks game
Facepalm
Lol gore hasnt scored a td since like week 3. Scores today
Rn
Looks so good
Dude blount
Ya thAT was
Lolol
Who dat say they gon beat thr saints!!! Who dat!
should be a good one
oo @Matt Wilfert
who does neil play next week
pep projected to win by 27 pts
bout to be 6-6 most likely
wow just wow
wow neil was 6-2 at one point
jeez neil. are u following in the footsteps of your brethren chris? that is, are u on the brink of losing 4 in a row?
cmon now
my flex nearly outscored your 5 players so far this week
lets be real
ur facing me next week
psh
and ull never have to deal with it again
just gimme username and password
i promise u if i had ur team i would score much more than u
ill make them much better
zach let me take over your team plz
Many*
Ur so fuckin bad
Zach howany fuckin times must i criticize u for starting a tight end at flex before u dont do it anymore
Gl neil
The only 2 players that pepke had play yesterday scored 18 and 20
Lol commiting to a qb and still keeping both on ur roster arent incompatible
Lol
Trade deadline over
Thats the best one^
6th: ur just bad
5th: letting me trade rape u over and over at the outset of the season
4th: trading away howard and cooks
3rd:continuing to believe in dak
2nd: relying on kenyan drake, alfred morris, and joe mixon as ur rbs
1st:starting a te at flex twice
Let me list all the ways zach fucked up this yr
Was zach paid to throw this season?
Ewww
Prescott pick again
Pts
Ya around 10
He was covered pretty well
Srs
In the endzonr
He dropped it
To him
Ya they just bombed it
Im pretty sure i could do better
Omg. The chargers backup kicker
Ok z just release all ur players
Lol prescott pick six
Bench u starters next week vs me z so u can save yourself the embarrassment
Damn all those alpha trades in vain
Lol u lost matt
I guess
Keenan allen a top 5 wr
Lol that gif
Z projected for 54 ð
Than morris
Lol theyrr giving more carries to rod smith
Its only 3rd quarter
Has like 360 yds and 2 tds
Dude rivers is fuckin killing
Quick 2 pts
I see u
Ok gordon
Gordon with 2 pts lol
Lol

40 yd td run
That wouod have been like a 10 pt play for prescott
Smh

Just a target
Cmon im not even asking for a catch
Alright cowboys. Lets get dez a target
Doctson*
So that i dont have to start dez

Im hoping docston goes off tonight
I think so matt
Meanwhile my rbs are climbin hard
They been falling hard
Well see how bell and hunt fare this week
Bench ur whole teqm next week against me. So that u dont disappoint yourself
I wanted to talk to

Awful just awful
Not only does dez not have a catch. The dude hasnt even been targeted
This is actually hard to watch
Dez hasnt been targeted a single time so far
Just wanna let u know again
Zach ur fuckin trash bud
So embarrassing
9 mins left in 2nd quarter. Prescott 0 pts
Is prescott even a good qb
Its gross
Dak prescott is fuckin dogshit without elliot taking the burden off him
Keenan allen a beast all of a sudden
I..i. Shouldnt have traded for deZ
This offense is crap
I know lol
So i dont feel like complete shit
Replicate that mjj performance
Alright leggo dez
In another chat
Vince was bragging about it
Lol i know
Is dominating
This lions special teams
3 blocks
Omgomg
Zachs*
Zachd looking at a sub 60 week again
Lol tate and lions d got a combined 3 pts
Theres rhodes
But my dude only managed 1 xp
I wish i got one of thoze last week
Lol
Of his eliteness
This will be the true test
Wow can stafford tie this up
This lions d is swarming
Idiot
Wow tate ran backwards
And another was just barely missed to an absolutely wide open dude
1 got called bafk
Honestly staff could have had 4 tds this game
Staff back

Vikes punting
Well see if staff is playing in a couple mins here
He rolled his ankle

After i trade him
Of course mjj gets td
Im snagging that dude
Keenum is actually that dude
Ya
Is exploding
Rudolph
Omg rudolph
Prolly
The latter
Not looking good kartik
Stafford looks lost
Berry was super high on tate this week
I was talking to mike
Zach does
If not for those?
So hed have 4 rn
Wait do fg blocks count for pts
Ur gucci
Tate is literally non existent in this game tho
Lol mike zaxhs d has 2 blocked fgs
U need to drop him
Ur kicker
Matt
Lolol
They target that dude so much
Thielen a top 5 wr prolly
Their passing game is impressive
Theyre really good at it
I know lol
Zachs so bad
Lol
Cmon its brett hundley under center
Nah. Steelers are gonna wreak hAvoc on pack offense
Damn this might be a really rough game for stafford
In first quarter
Correction 14 pts
Has like 12 pts at least already in first quarter
Why didnt i pick this dude up
Shit case keenums a beast
Some bs
Shit betyer get called back
Lolol thielen td off fumble recovery
Ehh ur prolly good rockin with steelers
Looking like garbo
This lions offense tho
Wowo redskins giants is big game for u tonight mike
5 of 9
Holy shit more than half zachs team plays today
Thielens gonna fuck me today isnt he
This is your last chance
Gogogo
Accept mine before its too late
Hes gonna be too late
Good wr
Good te
Quickkk
Acxept it
It ends in 2 mins!!
2 mins!!!
I just sent u it!
3 mins!!!
Accept it quick neil
Accept this shit eight now
Lol we have 5 mins to trade
I want him
How much are u looking for
We cant all be smart
I confess im a dumby
All signs pointed to it being ertz except the w and n.
Wentz had 3 of same 4 letters of ertz and identical last two. And i kinda just glanced at it and assumed it said ertz because u have two top 5 qbs. Wentz is like the most negligible upgrade plus u just dropped kelce
W.e.
Ur still dumb tho. And ur teams bad
My brain just spasmed
Wtf
I swear that read ertz
Im a dumby
Omg
Lolol
Matt doesnt have ertz dumby. Get yo head in the game. No wonder youve lost 3 in a row
The latter confirmed
Guys guys. Huge question: is neil the internets biggest troll or the earths biggest retard?
Jeez whyd i give him to vince so easily
Somehow dion lewis is projected 12....
But i guess 15 and 16 ought to be worried about less
His schedule isnt too appealing. Vince was trying to trade him to me recently. His week 12 15 and 16 are really bad. 13 and 14 are fine tho
Freeman*
Damn u still trust freema. Huh
Who is even on ur team now lol. I feel liek youve made so many moves in the last 2 weeks that idek anymore
But ya it was a good trade for u for sure
Lolol
This is the point at which u gulp
Because then u probably wont make playoffs
Tbh matt if u dont win this week none of them are gonna matter
4th: have yall watched a single bears game this yr?

5th: if yes, is the bears offense anything apart from jo jo? 

An answer in the affirmative to the 5th question is incontrovertible proof of not having watched one or just severe mental aggravation
Second question id hit them with: yall know that cooks the #1 wr on the patriots right? 

3rd question: yall know who the patriots are right?
Otherwise i would immediately probe them with the question: have yall even watched a bengals game this yr?
That could definitely alter their opinion
Wait matt. Those people who responded to your poll: they know that this trade occurred in a league which is non ppr right?
Actually maybe auction would be decent
On what interpretation
Ez?
Ya id rather do snake
And well see what thr outcome is
Lemmme scrutinize them
Fuck those ppl
Lolol
And ppl would get fucked
So many bluffs would be called in auction
True
Lololol
Idk if im high test enuf
Auction woukd be so high test
Pep easily removed from next yrs league
Dont accept anything from pep
Nah pepke initiated
Lets kick him out
Pepke just offered mike tom brady for 20 bucks
"Imma win off waivers"

"Who u picking up off waivers this week?"

"No one"
Off*
Who u getting of waivers this week big z
Lol
Morris for jeffrey straight up
Lol ew kartik. U already have a pretty good te
The 2nd funny thing youve said
U funny neil
Hahahaha
Someone trade with zach
So u can throw that out
To beat mike
Lol its def not gonna be zach
U guys are mean!
Make it go thru now!
Lol no
This week long bullshit is unjust
Win win
I get my dude
I mean u get ur dude for gametime if u decide to start marvin
Right now
Lets expedite that bitch
Matts an alpha what can i say
Oh
Mccoy for mathews
Lemme guess mike
On a side note: that offer u just sent me matt
I would easily vote to make an exception for a non explicit thing like this
Why would we appeal to them
They have huge bias
Forget what the non loonies think tho. They obvi want me to lose
How was i supposed to know
Unless someone can find this explicitly stated i think we shoukd make an exception
Case*
This casw doesnt appear to be explicit
I should have said no changes to explicit rules
Lol
Tell them the whole situation
Why has z chosen to flex tight ends twice this season
lol does sister not wanna make playoffs?>
sister projections looking good
w..e ur gonna need all the help u can get this week tho
lol ya somehow u finagled your way into that
def more fair that ertz trade
not a terrible trade tho
i guess only 2 of those solid pass defenses will apply to u tho since youre not making playoffs
ur team needed something
good for u
howard pretty good tho
gl to u neil
lel hilton playing the 1st 2nd 5th and 12th rranked pass ds after titans
in terms of good secondarys
prolly hardest remaining schedule in league
glhf with taht
check colts schedule neil
lol
neils team is still shit
W.e. well see what thr poll comes out to
Perhaps ya
That
Read thay
^^^
The fact that people are choosing a troll option makes me question how many others are taking the poll seriously
Legit
Why would it ever be lefit
That option doesnt even answer the question
Huh
Of this
Idk if i can trust the legitimacy
Then shit
If people are choosing that
That second option in your poll is just troll.... Can we take these results seriously
Etc
Tate Morris etx
I wanted dudes on his team
He could have easily done it
And not given up cooks ans howard
Thats precisely why he should have traded dor something other than te
Wtf is the second option
Tell them to answer amd give reason
U should add that
I want to hear justification from these yes'
Matr sister
Me kartik
Huge games in east this week
Lol
^
Id be a beast commish
Or something
Zach must have been masterbating to ertz highlight videos beforehand
The improvement was so negligible for what he gave up
Zachs actually mentally impaired
Tell me about it
V davis
Mixon himself might just not be that elite
Their line sucks
The offense just isnt even close to predicated around him
Just ask if its fair trade
Dont add anything in the explanation which promotes bias either
U do it matt
We dont have forum accounts. But u habe reddit dont u
Im tellin ya. I want a non loony free league next yr
Definitely
Should've been way better than mixon
Lol. Mixon involved in that trade was just nonsense
At least close to 50 50
Not just me. The whole league
Lol zach
"Too much emotion"
Citation plz
Emotion?
?
Sounds like hes wasted frewuently
From what mo tells me about his snapchats
He had to be
Idk wtf z was thinking..if z needed any improvement it wasnt at te
Especially given that z already had a pretty decent tight end
Nothing even comes close iirc
Easily most lopsided trade of yr. No debate
......
When did u choose ertz and mixon
I chose cooks 2nd rd
Z chose howard first rd
What were ertz and mixon again
U realize matt that howard and cooks were 1st round and second round picks respectively right
Omg i totally agree mike
Seriously. I wanna be commish next yr
Hes losing out guaranteed
So fuckin bad
Thats like 3 to 4 full weeks worth
Ive scored 300 more pts than him
Lol zachs team worst scoring team in the league by 100 pts
Dude hardly tries
Pepke is most certainly not in next yrs league
Lolol
3 games on thanksgiving!
Ur not starting jojo this week Matt?
More pts
Same record as mo
Wow im first in the league
Kamara and ingram will never score as low as montgomery and gillislee did
Now
Lol ull notice that 7 of those 9 spots are different players
Lol
Honestly i dont think it matters much who u play. Ur team is so bad
Im gonna beat u by at least 60
Good luck
And then me after that
What do yall know matts highest scorers apart from wentz were the 3 desperation trades he made this week
Fucked u*
Dude coleman conceding carries to ward fucked up matt
I want to start out by saying fuck u Zach. Ur collusion attempt failed
Omg. Dude if this goes into ot
Wtf kinda defensea are these
How the fuck did the hawks score in less than a minute
I cant watch
Im scared
Fuck
Dude Matt u still have a chance
Wtf
Fuck dude hawks scored too quick
I was like wait a sec
I know i was watching gamecast and i saw 4th down in field goal range several times for vikings. And then all of a sudden the ball icon would shift to rams
If i win im dedicating this win to pepke
Fuck im so lucky
I got this
I was like barring a russ pick
Lolol i know
Hawks have 1 timeout
Knee
Theyre gonna kneww
Ya
Otherwise
Theyd have 2
They only have 4 because of fumble recovery
But ya they played pretrt bad
Russell fumble td remember
6 of those werent theres
If i do holy shit
In our game
Whats the score matt. Im too scared to look
Fg
Why would they do that lol
I cant watch
We literally cant stop anything
So embarassing honeslty
Sack*
Dont have a single saxk2yet
Unless my d can get a turnover or some sacks
If i had to bet money id bet that youre gonna win
All u need is like prolly 30 yds from coleman
Theyre gonna keep losing pts
Not at all my defense is getting shredded
Stop it
Im gonna lose
Psh u serious
What happenee
Damn can lockett take one of these to the house
Is so fuckin embarrassing
This lack of pressure
The fuck kinda defense is that
He gets a 15 yd catch
Right as i say that
Were feasting on coleman tonight baby
That was kickoff btw matt
Thats my turnover
There we go
They should give him a lot of touches going forward
Mike davis looks good
For my d
I need a turnover
I should have started the falcons d. I was actually thinkinf about it
Smh
Lol that extra point counts against my d
God damn
Finally hawks get a 3rd down stop
Like just give me the L already
Sanu 1 handed catch
It
Falcons drive a alittle then ball gets tipped up in the air and we dont pick ot
Opening kickoff taken for like 60 yds. Pass interference put ball on 1 yd line. Coleman score.

Seahawks ball. Russell wilson pick on 2nd play of drive taken all the way back to seattle 40
Close to the worst possible start i could have wanted
In the first 5 mins
Idk how else to explain whats occurred
Seattle got paid to lose
I literally could have thrown better
Noo did anyone see that pass
Still might lose to me
Matt needed so many reinforcements to even stay close
I wouldnt doubt it
Mid tier
For
Theyre 16th in league in points foe
I dont see it being. Falcons havent scored too high this yr
Or w.e. the fug his name is
McDougall*
Im not too sure about mcdougak
Ya exactly
Im not too sure about kams backup tho
Ya shaq griffin a beast tho. And jeremy lane prolly one of the best backup corners in league
I hope my d steps up
Ya lol im pumped
Group Bitch removed Zach Freundt from the group.
Im gonna boot u if u keep doing this
Lol good luck then mate
Lets be real
Im gonna annihilate u with ur current roster
Ur team is desperate
Neil make me a trade not involving ingram kamara and green
Thats alright ull get em next yr
Now ur gonna lose out almost assuredly
Then u threw it all away
Z u were in such good position to make playoffs
And i want him now
I want morris
Lemme get kelce neil
#1 wr on best team in league
Jeffrey been hot
Ill give u jeffrey and someoen else for smith
Cmon ur team needs help
Lol
Lemme get alex smith
Lets trade neil
Better be
Now
I want hunt
Yo Chris are bell and hunt on limits now or what
1k all to winner
I wamt that 1k prize
100 next yr
And maybe tate
Except dak and ertz
Theyre all fringe starters
Did u expect them to do otherwise
Gl z
Lolol mike has fruendt next week
Ur just gullible
That was way too ez to predict
Told u that u weren't scoring more than 60
Howd ur knowledge of matchups do this week z
Lolol z -"you guys dont know matchups"
Theyre soo bad
If he wins against anyone
Hes easily losing out
Down
After this late season meltdoen
Idk if zs making the league next yr
Sigh
Its pathetic
Like who even scares u on his team anymore
And his team is easily the least aesthetic
He was talking so much shit
Zachs the biggest fool
If that makes sense
Zachs the dumbest smart person ive ever met
Explain
Idk how else to explai. It
To take me down
That trade seemed like hella collusion
Escapes me
How it didnt get vetoed
Easily the most lopsided trade of the season
His usage so low
Ya mixon isnt very appealing
Matts team was garbo befoee
Such bs
Matt was only even close to me owing to thia trade man
Zach is pathetic
^
So 7 pts
Because it was a 17 yd td
Noi should have 100
Lol nah. Bu thatd be bullshit
I would cry
Lol if i lost because of that
But only 1 shows up to his wrs
Passing
Wentz has 2 tds
No
Ill fucki. Flip
To this
If i lose
Noo
Wtf
Wtf is this
In fantasy
But its mot showing up
Jeffrey has a td
Wait matt
Lol
1 per 25 for u
Tds for me are 6. For u 4. Pts off yds are 1 per 10 for me
Than it is for u
If jeff does good for me that s better for me
My best bet is that Jeffrey cucks wentz
Ya this game shall be quite interesting tonight
Fuckin bs
Srsly
Srslu
Ur gonna lose out
Ur the laughingstock of the league now
I cant wait to play u
Neil ur team is dogshit
That just cant happen
Kicker who averages 15 a game got 1 fuckin poiny
My flex was a bust
I fugged up
Congrats
W.e. u prolly won this week matt
Now its legit
Before that trade matts team was garbo
So they said fuck it let matt get hella strong
Probably because people wanted me to lose this week
Did that not get vetoed
Why the fuck
It was that one
If there was any vetoable trade this yr
Thats why i was so furious when i saw the trade
I expected them to tho
It pisses me off that they did well too
Def not making playoffs
Ur losing out easily
Those were your best players
Were u like absolutely intoxicated when u made that trade
Ur team is dogshit
This week
Ur not scoring more than 60
What did i say zach
His team might be least scary in the league
Hes not making playoffs guaranteee
Z
I camt wait to annihilate
Z is such trash
Im still just baffled at z babys trade to matt
Like i predicted
An cj has a td already
Lol
Ya on last drive
Did it go to ot?
Lol
Ya
I was scared
I know wtf
Gahaha

Cousins for davante Adams
Neil what record will u have by years end

Lol
Non loony pride is rested in the hands of kartik now
There were others
Case keenum
Blake bortles will prolly do better than mariota tbh
Whyd u start mariota this week chris
Lol
Evidently too much then
Also neil. How much are u charging for cousins
Im going to send u an offer for delanie walker tho kartik
I wouldnt start that dude like ever
Ya lol

Right loonies
Sike
Your team has something special going doesnt it
All in the green
Neil. Impressive matchups this week
Ur coming for me arent u
With that trade
I see u matt
Ok who wants ingram. Thats it. He smart mouthed the coaching staff this morning and now we view him as an expendable part of our team
Youre coughing up the joint
Jeez u sick or something matt
Ur gonna be projected 1 more than me matt
Which vince says u are
If u get coleman
I hope big ben does well tonight
Nah in truth i think our matchup will be close
U guys wanna know what my theory is on matts sudden trades this week. I THINK HES SCARED
In his outlook theyre saying hes a wr2 this week. In what world is a wr2. projected 11
Dezs projected score is 1 less than his highest score all year
I think dez should be more like 8 like u said his median is
He played without zeke last week
Dez aint been on shit
Idgaf
No just no
How is dez projected 11....
These projections are fucked
Hes better than that
How is ju ju smith only projected 6
Im not sure about that one
12*
Michael thomas projected 13
Hes wr #32
How is keenan allen projected 9
Heh
So
I think ao
Ya
I thought
Zeke is coming back week 16
Can kartik establish himself as something to be reckoned with in this league
Will sister drop 5 straight
Is vince taking down the mighty neil
Whos beating who
So what are everyone's matchup predictions going into this week
And that was too far i guess
But when i offered it i tweaked it
Ya and he said yes
Have u speculated as to why these urges arise in me neil
Adams and martin for mckinnon Chris
i watched hiim frequently
he was at bama too
ya hes a big play or bust kind of guy
9 carries
his usage is sooo low
lol
drake got all of that on one run
So what do u think chris
we may have your first trade impending
check ur inbox @Chris Chan
nvm i want hyde more than mckinnon
lol golly guys did u see that swift and emphatic reaction
mckinnon for davante adams and doug martin
yo chris i want mckinnon
or excommunicated
you're either a first-rate mate
here at north shore there is no room for mediocrity
lol
i can imagine thats your only reaction
are u gulping when seeing my box score last week @Matt Wilfert
hahahahah
matts detriment
my gain
your loss
w.e. big ben gonna shred yall
but w.e.
at home
28th*

Embarrasing
Dude u shouldve seen some of the trade offers i got today
Lolol
Lol
Damn
Wow neils losing
Uh oh Neil

U wont do it
Ya right chris
Yall suck at trading
Ok srsly tho guys. Offer me something juicy
Lol
Ingram is better than ur whole team matt. Hes off limits. How many times i gotta tell u
Jeffrey
Ha
The number 5 wr in league is bench warmer apparently
Quote me
Less than 60 zach
Caused it
Losing 4 in a row
Finally huh
Oh ya chris
Lolol
Quote me
Z im betting u dont score more than 60 next week
Jeffrey and landry for wentz
Im all about it
Wentz for assets othet tha. Green kamara and ingram
Im not on ur side anymore
I def hope u dont make playoffs z
His te was fine
Zach do u see mixons usage
I have no other explanation
Is z like really drunk rn
Does anyone else think this is veto worthy
Have fun
U aint making playodds
Glhf z
Ur really bad z
Matt just trade raped u
Ur not making playoffs
Z ur actually retarded
Did i just see
Wtf
Uhhhh
Both my tes on bye or ir this week
My wrs other than green very good as i mentioned earlier
With sherman out*
Kicker wayy better than all of yours
My defense better than all of yours even without sherman out
Sike
Just pretend theyre noton my team
No ingram kamara and green of limits to everyone
Plz
Lemme get alex smith
Its true that a blockbuster is coming
Well im getting wentz tonight so
His ceiling isnt high enough to trade away zachs best player
Player
Why would he trade his best plauer
Zack has a te which isnt that far behind
Thats dumb
Id veto that
V Davis is good
Ew lol no u wouldnt
Lol no
Can u guys give me reaosnable trade offers plz
U cant be srs with that trade offer matt
Zeke for davante adams. Hundleys favorite target
Lol
Zeke for landry
Ingram for anyones whole team tbh
Ew. Id be getting worse
Lol
Block it rn
Deal
Ok mike
No joke if chris came to me and was like "bell for kamara straight up" id honestly turn it down. Thats how much i value saints rbs right now
Ehh that should have easily been 100 yds if he was good
In league
Against worst d
Why didnt darkwa do better mike
Then u should want to keep him right
Then if thats true
Gimme smith for cheaper
Ya thats what i thought
Ok then gimme smith
Kamara way more valuable to me than kirk is to u
Psh
Nah marks basically off limits unless first rounders are involved
Kirk for who neil
Who are u realistically looking for for cam
Me by a wide margin
Lol who has the most trades in this league again
And its mean
Youre trolling me
But lets make something happen
Not for anything crazy
Yo chris lemme get cam
Villain*
Im a villian i know
Namely your rbs
Decided to*
I would like to make inquiries concerning your other assets
However
After due consideration Matthew i have decided discontinue trade talks concerning your qbs
Followed by aj green for russell wilson
This week
Mark Ingram for mike evans is #1
yo mike let me get latavius
are u entirely unwwilling to give up hunt or bell @Chris Chan
doesnt see enough touches
anderson is trash
lol i realized that was bad for me
shit will get u a losing record
like @Chris Chan
cant be stubborn in fantasy
but youre stubborn
shouldve jumped off the winston train way long ago
nah i think your team was fine. i just think your decision as to who to play at qb was awful week in week out
Lol i swept mike
Do yo research before doubting my squad mike
Bout my team
Alll these falsehoods being raised
Tryna clear the air first
Chill
I will matt
Check the box score  this week to confirm
Ur wrs are dogshit. Matter of fact ur whole team is
Do u even have a wr inside top 15 sister lol
Its truth my friend
Not sure why thats ur favorite line lol
Yourself
Verify it for youraeld
Thats not fiction. Check the charts. That pefomance literally boosts him inside top 10
soo not sure what youre talking about @Mike Vacala
and jarvis landry might be depending on how he does tonight
so yes 5 of 6 are 100% inside the top 15
lol mike. 3 of my dudes currently are explicitly top 15 in terms of position rank.

then u got davante adams who just scored 15 this week who was wr 18 coming into this week. the dudes who he has passed up who were ahead of him are: jordy nelson. chris hogan. will fuller. mike evans.  etc. so yes hes top 15.

then you got robert woods. who was position rank 39 going into this week. well he just scored 29 poitns which puts him top 15. he passes up like a million dudes ahead of him.  

and finally u got jarvis landry. who is currently position rank 21 who i believe will fare rather well tonight and put him inside the top 15.
Ill give u jeffrey and another wr for russ
That means that yall are fighting for the other 9
I have like 6 top 15 wrs
I dont need a wr neil
Lol u literally offered a better deal last night and i was like nah. Then u subtract crowell
Yall srs
Wtf
Eww to both neils and matts trades wtd
U block something
U seem like the desperate one lol
Ive only wasted ur time in the past because im negotiating with several people at a time. Im trying to get the best offers
Ur like idek who i want feom ur team
Check ur responses
Lol
Uhh ur saying this as if my request for ur qbs this morning wasnt indicative of my acknowledgement that ryan isnt that good
4 tds in last 5 games for landry
Yo neil. Elliot for jarvis landry
Actually
And matt too
If i cant strike a deal with those 2 then ill never strike one
Ok according to my calculations the people most in need of receivers are sister and vince
Lol ew
Lol
So idk
Perhaps that makes us unsuitable trade partners kartik because u have some good wrs
Lets make it happen bois
I want rbs. I can offer u wrs.

This goes for anyone. If any of yall need wrs i need an rb
K think up an offer. Ill do the same. Make it reasonable.
Lets make a trade kartik
I never thought id say this but: after doing some research kartiks team is actually pretty good
Lol
Ill give u kamara and Jeffrey for antonio brown kartik
I dont want cj anymore. Hes trash
That dude hasnt found paydirt since week 1
Lets be real u need receivers. The fact that u have been starting keenan allen since day one is befuddling to me
Yo Chris ill give u aj green and alshon jeffrey for either hunt or bell
Lol
We need to have a metric which accounts for both
Ya
And still lose
Is Vinxe going to post way more pts than u shitties
How many times
No this is actually unfaor
Ha
Mo creeping back
Uh oh kartik
Lol
Bad defenses are bad. Always keep that in mind
I told u otherwise
Why did u start gianta
Lol didnt i tell u neil
Now hes all mine
Yall shouldve scooped him up
Dude robert woods is a young stud
Lolol
If i still had players left to play i would sit them out of respect for running upp the score on Chris
And cheated
I went behind ur backs
I confess
Ban me
Im guilty
Imagine if i had d wat
And remember this is all happening without d wat. The best player ij league
Glhf everyone
I have really good dudes on byes too
Lol
I thought neil Was for sure losing after graham hit him with a 2 td game on thursday

The bucs d is trash
Last night i was like hmm i feel like matt should start powell
No joke
Ya i was actually going to advise u to do tjat matt

after teh first minute its alright. but the first minute is sooo relatable
i was rofling at the first minute
lol yall need to watch that
http://watchseries.do/series/the-league/season/1/episode/4
boyle rather*
is that greg in the front of pic
stickboa
ur team looks small lol
what yall win
are those the twins
ok let me get crowell then

lemme get henry @Neil Nijhawan
lol im probably going to wait until after tomorrow to do it
now what about aaron jones
ok ill send it
i also want aaron jones if hes available
straight up
landry for cj
thats reasonable
tell me who u want for him
ok
if youre not feeling that trade let me know what u want for anderson
i wanted some of ur bench players and ur wr situation seems like it could use an upgrade
yo chris i sent u a trade
and no kartik this is not time for your comments about my urges
yo neil lemme get henry
Lol i was asking because i never have and i wanted to know if yall recommend it
Have any of u guys watched the tv show "the league"
But he done
I know lol
Just ordinary running with wr
Tore achilles
:(
Damn rich sherman might be done for yr
I got scared
Lol ya
Baldwin or matts score?
How was that not a fumble
Even sherman was confused af
Right chris
Wut
Waitt....
This game*
Not really lol. I feel like this in particular is going fast
Lol
My d sickkk
Saftey bitchessss
Lolol ya
I lold so hard at that part
Omg no the funniest episode in season 4 is thr trade negotiations between the raptors and magic
Watched it all already
Ya lol. I linked all of season 4 earlier
Yup
Fuck u and ap mo
Lets fuckin gooo boizzz
Fumble recovery
First play of cards
Omgomgomg
i cant tell if kartik actually intends to start the bengals defense which is projected 5 points or if hes just trolling
the nickname i gave him is very fitting
omg neils projections without elliot are sooooooo loowww
inb4 on saturday morning we read headlines "elliot eligible to play again after blah blah blah"
hes soo lucky to have gotten him
neil must be punished for using a 3rd round pick on this dude
that fuckin snake man
ya i know lol
u said that as if u wished it to be true but it wasnt
then
well why did u say that^^^
when does it start?
Funny af
Really cheesy
Gridiron heights isnt even very funny
Game of zones is way funnier tho
Look it up on YouTube
Its called game of zones
The nba version is hilarious too
Lol ya
but personally i think i would put my faith in wentz more often than russ. but u are sort of forced to start russ given that wentz has a bye this week
i feel like russ has a lower floor than wentz, but maybe a higher ceiling
to quite unguarded targets
russ has had some pitiful overthrows
sometimes in fact more often than not this yr russ and the offense look out of sorts
do u have full trust in russ?
the hawks offense scares me sometimes tho @Matt Wilfert
they have been of late so im confident
i hope my hawks d dominates
lol RUSSSS
Is that
Lol wtf
Like u*
Packers receivers arent worthy of starts
I like most of ur team except for drake like mentioned and jordy nelson
Whats there to be confused about
Champ select is a lobby in which u select your character in the game league of legends
Bank account is the name of a song
Whered i lose u
Af
And i started loling hard at
Lol i typed some bank account lyrics in my league champ select lobby namely "i might pull up in a ghost noooo casper".

And a few minutes went by and i was saddened by the fact that nobody had responded and so i thought nobody understood me :(.

But then this random dudes like "and i be smoking gas and i got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Ms in my bank account"
at least were getting somewhere
so neil does admit taht his shittalking has occurred
doesnt mean its not shittalk
just because mos shitalk isnt as intricate and calculated as mine
hes done it literalyl 2 times tonight alone
he talks hella shit
in terms of quality
but
in terms of quantity he doesnt really talk shit
how come non loonies never talk shit to mo? yall scared or something?
And it is my duty to see that your tutelage is reasonably managed
For u are my pupil
And this tidbit will enlighten u ohh benighted kartik
Lol there is visible distinction to be made here which was the source of our confusion. You seem to be using what philosphers call the "de dicto" version of the definite description "best player". Whereas I was using that definite description in the "de re" sense.


The de dicto sense entails that the definite description "the best player" refers to whoever happens to qualify for that title. 

The de re sense entails that the definite description "the best player" is restricted to a particular object or set of objects in mind.


To give an analgous example suppose a girl named marry says " i want to marry the tallest man in lake county".

The de  dicto sense of the definite description "the tallest man in lake county" entails that mary means she desires to marry whoever happens to satisfy the compound  predicate "tallest man". 

The de re sense of the definite description "the tallest man in lake county" would have mary mean that she has a particular person in mind who in fact is the tallest. She just didnt refer to his proper name
However i would still call him the player with the most potential on my team
Not dependent on him at all
Idk what u talking bout
Soo
Lol my best point totals have come in the last 4 weeks when aj has had a bye or scored 3. 8. And 0
Aj green scored 0 for me last week. Still scored 100??
Creative ehh bois
Group Bitch set the nickname for Kartik Hegde to straight hype.
Group Bitch set your nickname to bell or bust.
Group Bitch set your nickname to bell or busy.
Group Bitch set the nickname for Neil Nijhawan to Elliot dependent.
Group Bitch set the nickname for Mo Latif to mo killa.
Group Bitch cleared the nickname for Mo Latif.
Lol mo has both the #1 rb and wr ð°
For*
Cramped house entails statistical consistency but shit whos looking dor consistency at this point in season. We need explosiveness for that playoff push
Equals cramped house
High floor low ceiling
It seems
Af
Dez house cramped qf
His floor fairly high tho
Even shitty ass recievers have scored more lol
Hasn't scored over 12 iirc
He living in a shack
Dez ceiling is low af
Lol if blount werent probably going to be less of a factor due to ajayi i would possibly do that if i were matt
I..i want him!
suffer me to have one plz
might i have one too @Neil Nijhawan
gonna be baller for the rest of the yr
and the lions throw a shitload
got a super ez schdule ahead of himi
hes a beast
marvin jones @Mike Vacala
why would u desire to adopt it
thats an ignominious title @Matt Wilfert
like a bitch!
lol matt clings to his title of non loony
thats correct ka@Kartik Hegde
hmm i wonder
and there is also a visible surplus in my receiving corps
corps*
there is a visible privation in neils receiving coprs this week
matt
i was just counting loonies in this chat
not that suprising
i mean he probably feels similar about me so
lol for some reaosn yall crafted this narrative that pep and i were butt buddies.. in truth i like pepke less than every other loony
z babys eli manning meme was funnier than the sum of non loony joke attempts
youll also notice how i actualyl talk shit to loonies as well. the non loonies never talk shit to eachother. they just suck eachother off
idk really what the function of those statements are
not funny
tbh
pretty useless ones
ive heard many such statements ^^^
so really what are their merits
they arent funny despite their desperate attempts to be
whats their use
they dont trade and hardly talk seriously
why wouldnt i want them banned
non loonies are disagreeable
lol
the idgaf part
LETS GET SOME BLOCKBUSTERS GOIN FELLAS!
wow
wow the trade deadline is nov 22
huhhhh matt?
a stacked roster.... full of shitties!
lolol
w.e. yall gonna get pounded
wow compared to last week ppl hardly took advantage of the waivers
GIVE HIM BACK
damn kartik i wanted forte
hes gonna make yall rue the day u passed on him
he gonna smack yall in 2 weeks
shame
yesss none of yall went after greg olsennn
Thats good z
Lololol
Nah bich
Bucks are sick now
Wow bledsoe to the bucks
ours or the other one?
which league do u feel most confident in winning?
bad defenses are bad defenses no matter who they play
thats kind of like matt playing the 49ers d last week vs the cardinals... its like ya the cardinals offense is pretty bad without david johnson and carson palmer but... its the fuckin 49ers
even aside from them playing the 9ers
why would u ever
lol theyre the 31st ranked d
am i gonna make it 4 this week?
damn sisters lost 3 in a row
ya i thought not
yall ever have that predicament?
that predicament where u dont want to drop anyone for free agents because your teams is all around too good<<<<<
Thats how bad the packers defense is
The lions didnt punt a single time this game. The last time they didnt punt was 1971......
Lets make an exception for him
Vince deserves to be in playoffs
Damn vince woupd have beaten all of u except me and mo
Lolol theyre going for jones jr again. For his 3rd td
They look dismal on offense and defense
Calling it now
I dont think the packers will win another game this yr
Yall lucky a rodgers hurt. I would have a beastly davante adams too
Ya thats me bois
My receivers this week: 21. 20. 9 and then aj green with 0 because of ejection
Maybe matts are closest
Im telling yall. Yalls receivers aint even  close to mine
Damn bois marvin jones tho
Sister
Hes looked better than aaron jones
In limited touches today Montgomerys looked good
Why did i drop him
Montgomery might have the starting job back fuck
The packers are so hard to watch without a rodgers
Before it
I was a huge cavs bandwagoner
Ya im salty about his decision
The world*
Hes a dumb baby
He cut all contact*
Dudes just dumb
His decision to leave was a pussy ass decision. Plus last playoffs he cut all combination with his teammates. And his interviews after the trade. Plus he thinks the words flat
Kyries a baby
Lol fuck kyrie
He has like 10 yds
He lost
Aaron jones isnt doing shit
Lolol
I traded him rather*
And might beat me
And vince is currently starting him
Wtf was that
One of the main reasons i dropped abdullah is because he didnt get goalline carries
Fuck
Aaron Jones getting clogged up today
Damn my receiving corps is good
Look*
Lol he did looks slow af
Ya i didnt suspect u wanted to give up jojo
i uhh.. idk if u were kidding but i dont have ajayi z
Green and martin for jo howard
For green and someone else decent sure
Ajayi??
??
Crowell and ju ju smith for jeffrey
Assuming hogans still hurt
Hogan and evans out this week
I got u boi
Looks like u need some receivers neil
I know
Lolol
A*
Yo who needs wrs? Im stockpiled with them. I need an rb
Mo literally offered me hopkins for green lol
For green
Hopkins*
Jones for green
Jones for cook
Or if ur just stupid
I cant tell if ur trolling mo
Othet than next week when he has a bye
Now im starting that dude probably every week hereafter
And could've used a boost
I was mostly talking to the ppl who losy
Except hilton
To how many of u did i offer alshon jeffrey this week for someone on ur team? Thats too bad for u guys he did better than all of your receivers
So
Im the man of this league now
Hunt or bell. The rest of ur team is trash
Now with that said give me hunt
Ur losing to scrubs
0 trades aint helping too much is it chris
For*
Thats what making trades are far. So that you can pickup hot players. 

Chris is holding on to keenan allen like hes going to the grave with him
I guess hes still decent
Ive outscored him 4 of last 5 weeks. But actually his scores havent been as bad as i thought
Well just compare our scoreline the past 4 weeks. Whos trending up whos trending down
Maybe the next one after that
Heck naw
Next week against me
Heck naw
This week?
His whole team (his rbs) are falling off cliffs
No wonder why sisters falling off
Hes returning to a form which i thought might be reasonable
Stats
Look at his stata
I love it
Hunt is regressing hard af
Its because we have so much other trash in this league
I know
I k
Hahahah
Trashboa

Lolol
Yall are gonna get rocked"

-me monday night
Evans and Kirk for green
No
Yo z u want aj back? Lemme get dak and cooks for aj
Nfl too many injuries
D wat
Rodgers
The nfls two best qbs this yr arguably
I know
tfw when u realize i copped ur entire squad
lolol
I give u jeffrey
Z lemme get drake plz
Evans for doug martin
My bench is stocked therewith
I can give u a wr which u might think is better
I cant really help u there
Ohh
Cuz i want him
If u truly believe it
Ok give me him cheap then
?
I have stills lol
I want Parker
Hes been hurt
Woah zack ur boy josh gordon being reinstated
I dont think anyones giving up anything more
Prolly ur best bet
Or aaron jones
Maybe u should try hogan for mckinnon
Ur right. Jordan reed for Hogan
Hogan
Listen neil. Matt ryan for higan
Not sure what ur looking at bud
He has 5 tds lol
Look around at the rbs in the league. Hypothetically which one do u think is fair for Hogan straight up
I dont think anyone givinf up something good for him
Psh
What quality of rb are u expecting for hogan
What u talking about z
Srsly
Not at all
??
Even without
Ur value prolly falls somewhere from 4 to 7
Does the value 10 represent absolutely fucked? And 1 guaranteed playoffs?
Lemme think it over
Ok
Green for aaron jones fuller and anderson
Evans for ingram
So who else wants green
I dont think there is any trade involving green and not involving brown that wohld be beneficial for my team then lol
For green and jeffrey
A brown and walker
If im trading u green i need a brown involved
Ew
Im willing to trade green
Why would i want him
Ajayis literally worse than my rb1 rb2 and flex
I want Hogan
Nah just walker for jones
The language z used confused me for a second. I was like wait since when did he get rb1s? Then i realized he was using the terms differently
Good link
Lol
Rb1 in that theyre merely starting for their respective teams?
Drake? Morris?
Delanie for marvin jones
Yo kartik lemme get delanie walker
Did matt ask u for d hop lol
Matt literally has nobody who would be worth
Lol why would u ever trade him
Lol wasnt monday night against denver such a game? He had 1 pt
This is a curious pattern
Look at his stats
Why is tyreek hill absolutely dominant away but absolute garbage at home without fail this season
Yo kartik when we lightin up a blunt homie
Things wouldve been much different
Ur lucky that not  a single one of my rbs nor wrs nor te met their projections
Ill see u in the playoffs
U got lucky
Ur team trash tho
Seeing mo with any waiver activity at all is comical tbh
Lol seeing mo being a waiver tryhard is hilarious
Evidently not
Has he uhh watched a single quarter in which hundley has played this yr?
Only the great lord knows the thought process behind that one
Lolol pepke added brett hundley
Lemme get him vince
Wow kelvin benjamin to the bills
My projected scores the remaining weeks will testify
Me duh
Week*
Wow the non loonies are fucked this weel with byes. Im predicting losses for all 3
Thats good af for ajayi
Wow lol
Psh
D wat for howard
D wat for bell
Dwat for mccoy
Yall gonna get rocked
Lets go
Matthew berry compared d wat to fantasy superman lolol
How the fuck has nobody picked him yet
For the absence of his best player
Yes lets punish him loonies !
Should be interesting
Wow neil only has loonies left
Lolol
Mayb. Even with
Without elliot
Shit u lost
Ohh mo
Who u got next week
He gonna become desperate
Gone
Well he aint gonna be a troll anymore once his best player gome
And not for fuckin green plz
Or Hogan
Lemme get parker
Ya
Unless u count this one
Ya
He just had big plays
If u actually look at it hunts touches  were never that high
Theyre coming down to earth
Bell and hunt were untouchable in terms of trading. Idk if they are anymore
Hmmm
Hey uhh Chris now that youre .500 maybe u shoupd uh.... Make some trades..

Ur trade total is at a solid 0
Happens to me almost every week
Thats crazy af
Ya lol literally everyone
Fortunately for the rest of the league
Hunt has been playing like a normal human recently
Ouch
4 and 4 record
Maybe his team isnt the powerhouse we all thought
Wow chris lost again
Nah
If u were 4 and 4
Only because youre 6 and 2
Wtf
He says everyone else is off limits
Yet his team sucks ass
Somehow the only dude peps willing to trade is demaryious thomas
Ok
Well see
Ill send u a deal with green most likely in
Ok ill think about it
Or if u are gonna start him
Lemme get him if ur not gonna start him
U have fuller right
Lol ya. I dont want him
Ill send u an offer for either of them later
Ok
With that
I can help u
Lemme get at least 1 of the 2
U have 3 spots with 5 to work with
Let me get at least 1 of those 2 u dont end up starting
Ok chris. For next week your viable starters at your 2 RB spots and flex are: bell. Hunt. Anderson. Aaron jones. Mckinnon.
Seattle defense on the block
Omg
Love it
My d vs my qb
Yup
D wat
Omg
Lolol
my teams coming today! my teams comin today!
we got 45 mins till kickoff
is uhh z baby gonna fix his lineup
against a top 3 run defense too
how lucky
wow the week neil starts crowell he scores his first td
Hes always got swagger back there
U never see t Brady look like that
Not composed ever
He looked rattled in there
Couldnt throw downfield more than 10 yds
Dude their qb
Y
Yes
Ajayi for davante adams
His stock is soo low now lol
Just wow
Wow
On u
Has 27
Vinces defense
Matt
Omgmg
Is such trash
This miami offense
Ajayi is toast this game
Kartik looking good
On first run tonight
Ajayi for longest run of season
Deshaun watson for ajayi
Lol
No aj leaves tonight
Brown and lynch for aj and doug
Duke johnson jr
And deal
Or djj
Antonio and lynch
Matt ryan and davante adams for ajayi
Not even close
Lol. His wrs would be undisputed best in league tho
Green for ajayi and thielen
Blockbuster
Straight up
Green for freeman
Thats it
Ok matt
Elliot for seahawks d
But i wagered higher
What i really wanted was hill and mccaff the whole time
Take notes
U see how i worked that mike
Or what
What will it be? Hill and mixon for doug and jeffrey
As for u matthew
In ur inbox
Its a fair trade
Accept it kartik
Yall hypes
Heh
Ohh ur trade
Ryan for ajayi
Yes he is
Its fair
Ya matt
Which ones fair z
Whos projected 2 more pts than hill this week
Doug and jeffrey
For Doug
Hill and mccaf
Replace mixon with mccaf
Screenshot
Ya no thx
The hilton and mcafrey one matt?
furreal tho ingram for inman
u realize trubisky threw the ball a grand total of 7 times last game right
lol
hurdles niggas all day
have u watched him
hes athletic af
on my teams page
check his outlook for this week
srs
in new orleans there is word thatkamara is the new reggie bush
who wants to bet me!
i got saints with 50
lets bet
they lose
ill bet u 50 bucks
theyre not gonna win
hell nah
pshh
against any opponent
for ingram and kamar
ez money
the saints at home
good luck
pshh
I knew u were a ()
Lol
Do u lock it tho (((((((()))))))
Switch tyreek for hilton and ill accept right now
Lol
U were a ()
But
With dez and freeman
I mean i still wanna do our old deal
Lol for who
unless u can get something juicy for it
with luck in hilton is gonna be a god
they say hell be back in 3 to 4 weeks
i think ur best bet is to wait on hilton. unlike what neil said about luck not returning this yr ive heard differenlty
thats decent... i mean.. i went on the waivers and got wr #15 if that clarifies anything
hes wr #18
well lets just see what his position rank is
without hiim
i agree
hiltons a beast with luck
but he doesnt have that much to show for it with raw stats
idk if id call mccaffrey "great". hes doing rather well in terms of his involvement in the offense thats true
and ur interpretation of their play on the field yes?
idk what u talking about
llol
the things u cited were not things on paper
u forget to mention those key factors
and whose team is garbage af
a dude whos lacking a qb and o line so bad
ty hilton
or get many carries
a rookie rb whos unlikely to get in the endzone much
y
likewise
youd say hell nah
imagine if i said adams for freeman
adams for freeman. cuz doug is onlny averaging 1.5 less ppg than freeman
so imagine if i told u
i value hilton right now without a good qb the same as i value davante adams
think about what youre offering
Then we can talk
If u wanna give me hilton and mmcaf or hilton and mixon for Doug
And prolly not even
I would trade doug for dez at the very least
Stawp
What are u looking for
Ur charging too high for him i bet
Just not worth with brisset
Luck wont be back for another month
On same team
Show me a duo with higher
Their combined projection is 24
Find me one better
In terms of duos on the same team
The saints backfield duo is easily the best to have going forward
So is kamara
Ingram gonna shit on ya this week boa
;)
Changes his opinion weekly
Ah dont listen to this loony matt^^
lol actually eeww thielen doesnt have a td
for green
ajayi and thielen
nah
lol
for green
i want ajayi and someone else
aj green for ajayi straight up
deshaun watson for ajayi
is what im talking about
ur bad
then definitely not smoother
if saving time is any consideration
lol a lot smoother.. how do u figure
Whether kartik likes it or not
Ajayi is coming to my team tonight
I hardly want that trade
Nah u offer it kartik
aj green and doug martin for ajayi and diggs
howard
def not as much as howrad
srsly
ur losing that z
i would take that all day if i were k@Kartik Hegde
eww
then isnt it
well its a good thing youre gonna give me ajayi
and i want him now
kartik i want ajayi
howard for deshaun straight up
I want howard
Lol i dont want tate
Ok z for what
To*
How much are u looking for for a player who is going ro be suspended for 6 games
Furreal tho zeke for adams
Gtfo
Higher than him
Check my qb brah
I cant tell whether you think you're humorous by including cousins in there or youre just stupid
Zeke for davante adams
Aj green leaves tonight
aj green on the block
who
For the right price i am matt
On a lot of them
U should have been more patient
From bottom to top
Ur whole draft was clutch
Lol
Hes gonna throw the bait
Hes gonna trick vince into cheating
Vince is purposely throwing
Srsly wtf
Hahahaha
In that occurrence
Im catching something fishy
Wait..
Makes his value significantly less
Only cuz nelson dont got rodgers till week 15 at earliest
Nah i actually dont think its too out of line
The non loonies finally with a good cause
Love this cause
Yess
Ill easily vote yes
He thought it was enticing because he didnt do research
I offered him a way better one involving aj green
Idek why he thought it was enticing
Wasnt*
Guarantee
If vince was entirely filled with apathy about this league due to his record i fuckin guarantee he would not have made that trade
Instead of giving up one of his best players
So many dudes
Stills
Who is pr 15
Like kearse
He could have gotten better dudes off the waivers
Really quick
And look at his
Look at ur dudes position ranks
Its unfair
Pshh hel ya
Sup
Only because u made a trade in a relatively close time frame to his and u probably for some reason felt that if vinces got vetoed thered be a higher chance for yours to get vetoed
My first suspicion was u
I figured as much z
Why is this dude in our league
Fuck u mo
Letss goo
It got vetoed
Lolol
Who is the perpetrator
We must get to bottom of this
There was a 3rd person to uphold the trade apart from mo and Vince
Well boys we have a crime on our hands
U seem too focused on the post deal values mo. While those might be somewhat even the predeal values are anyrhing but
A discrepancy sufficient to warrant a veto imo
While ginn and jackson could be valuable to vince and miller could be equally valuable to u, there is a decently sized discrepancy between the value to your respective teams before the deal
The value of the players being dealt by team A  before the deal. The value of the players recieved by team b after the deal. 

And the other two values gotten by substituting "b" and "a" up there^^
Regardless of how valuable those wrs will be for vinces team in the future there are 4 values we should always look at in any trade
Where is the fairness
Ur giving dudes who were gonna invariably warm ur bench for a dude who would always start for vince
For a dude that vince valued or rather "ought to have valued if he wasnt indifferent af about this league because his record sucks" rather highly
How is it fair
Ur giving up dudes u were never gonna use again
Everyone veto vinces and mos trade
Yup we need to put a stop to this
Vince clearly didnt consult the snap count or target numbers for those dudes
Dudes he was never gonna use again
Mo didnt give up shit
He had to give up hyde
At least z babys trade was somewhat fair
We need arbitration in here
Exactly
For a low tier rb1 ya
The remainder of the year
Mo gave up a two dudes who were certainly gonna ride his bench
To get that
Mo didnt have to give up anything of value
I think imma veto
Srsly
Group Bitch voted for "me" in the poll: Who's gonna leave the group chat next?
Lol
Ya he prollymeans thT
^^?
The dude just confirmed what i said about his weird trading desires
Those*
Vince lost both thoae trades
Lol
ya i dont want him back next yr
not that u do all those neflectful things i just named. but u do some. and that is suffcient
looks like u gone
FUCK NAH
im just gonna answer this one for u
if anyone in the league precludes the rest of the players in teh league from deriving optimal satisfaction should they play in that league any longer
final question
well shit @Vincent Maltese
vince- "yes"
and dont u think this neglectful attitude deprives us of similar satisfaction in fantasy football?
vince- "yes"
do u get less satisfaction from beating ppl in fantasy baseball when they have made 0 pickups or trades and they never adjust their team for injuries or off days
now since weve determined u get at least some satisfaction heres the next question
im just gonna answer this one for u: yes,  otherwise why have u played for l ike 5-10 yrs or however long
question 1: you get satisfaction from fantasy baseball
vince let me ask you a few questions to get an understanding of whether your actions have been worthy of ban for next year
He has a penchant for some weird players
Not only does he take years to decide he makes really odd decisions
Trading with Vince is ruff
Ya he did
Ohh bears
That was matt
Vikings?
Should be banned
I think both Vince and pep
If we do a league next yr vince shouldn't b3 in it if hes gonna have this mindset
Ya i know i shouldve kept him
Kinda stupid
Well why u in thr league then
im keen on him
whatchu want for dez
hes wr #4 so thats good
cooks is seemingly justifying the 2nd round pick i used on him
and his team is just utterly bad
hyde is slightly more risky than i want
see z i would do our trade but
alshon jeffrey is ranked higher than both those clowns in like literally everything
desean jacksons like literally only a deep threat
ted ginns two solid games the last two weeks were more flukish than anything
ive watched pretty much every saints game this year
are ranked #27 and #75 in targets in teh NFL
the receivers u just got
vince do u even do any research or watch the games
i tried to help u
eww vince have fun with your team still being atrocious
yes
Hyde for doug martin
Yup lets all get our vetoes in
U with me z
Im vetoing
Aaron jones and keenan allen for aj green and kamara
If u gave me cam
Or what position u looking for
Do u want ryan?@Chris Chan
Yo chris lemme get cam
Fuck
More like: how in the fucj
So tyreek hill is position rank #2. Pretty cool pretty cool
i wish i had him
out of nowhere
a jones is a beast now apparently
ya true
zs on the rise
he has bell, gronk, and allen out
wow zach guess what fortunate tidings have come to me about your win probabilities vs team sister week 9
true
true
lolol
lol nah
ill think it over
ok offer it to me
haha
or green and martin
yo z. hyde and cooks for green and kamara
but w.e.
i think my trade to u in your pms was the  most
screenshot teh winner with a red circle around it
which one is the most enticing
who else dalton gonna throw to to engender that comeback
good then that means u want green. cuz who else will spearhead that comeback
maybe even more than decent
against mediocre and less opponents hes decent
id wager hes gonna throw at least 2-3 tds this week at home aginast indianapolis tho
ha
mixon...
ha
lafell....
who does green have?
gronk. cooks. amendola. white.. etc
hogan has too much competition tho
his roster is looking emaciated
kartik needs upgrades tho
but not good enough
actualyl not that ass
lol neils trades ass
and ill throw in kamara
green for ajayi and diggs
offer it
deal
Aj green on block
(Turns head slowly to kartik)
Matt ryan on the block
Lol
Shouldve went for younger more spry players
U wasted too early of picks on lynch and gore kartik.
 The grandfathers of the NFL
Im surprised lynch is ass
Lol well youve lost two straight. So maybe u should!
Who u looking to trade

over the past 10 to 15 years

look around the league
bamas players are just nasty in general
drafting eddie jackson was clutch. bamas secondary players are always nasty. citation: haha clinton dix
its quite small
this year for good qbs?
does the list get longer?
d wat. a smith. prescott. brady. wentz.
is this real life?
the most yards for the receivers is cobb with 15
cuz they aint doing shit henceforth
welp its time for everyone to shed all of their packers receivers
36 mins to 12
i knew my eyes werent deceiving me
no fuckin wonder. the panthers are literally tripling the bears time of possesion
ive literally seen them with the football icon for like 90% of the fuckin time
why, when im watching the scoreboard for the NFL do i see the panthers almost constantly with the ball yet onnly have 3 poitns
u should easily get this w
vinces team is doing poor
wow
u had a single player at 12 and thurs?
what in the actual fuck
wait z u still have 8 players yet to play...........
of late
hes poppin off
someone needs to pickup his josh mccown dude
hence i went forward and snatched a lot of ur dudes
i envied it
ill reiterate it: your draft was really good
hahahha
the second u trade him
he starts poppin off
ya lol
im glad i didnt bite
and of course mo fell for it
he was a hype
ya
How the fuck did the cavs get smashed yesterday when the magics 2 best players were out
Or nearly so
Hes top 5 qb so far if im not mistaken
Hell prolly do work
Ehh prescott a beast
Smfh
Lol. Pepke being up 33 with only one player having played is just a facepalm
Wow a rodg might come back in 6 weeks if pack still in playoff race

lol who scored the most this week @Neil Nijhawan
in what form was i trying if not in the form of a trade?
it wasnt collusion
vince actualyl wanted this trade
let me screen shot that too
so then i made a counter offer to @Vincent Maltese
check it bois
let me copy paste that real quick
said no
but i like the good guy i am
wanted to give up all his players
so vince immediately proceeding the news of rodgers injury and his loss to sister
mo framed my words such that it seems like im the bad guy here
but i promise it is anything but that
like im a colluder self-branded
and it seems like the evidence is stacked against me
now i know it looks bad guys
For what its worth
Let me defend myself
Im frustrated
Lol but realtalk. Why did this get vetoed
That i would have gotten away with it too if it werent for meddling mo
Now i would first like to say
Howdy gentleman
Eric Alfonso left the group.
Off*
Lol i um wanna see the proof for your hypothesis "the more trades u make the worse of youll be"
Get to giving me premises boa
U dont support ur claims at all
Mo ur basically a non loony
My grandma could draft a fantasy team going off pre draft rankings and make playoffs
Or minimally at least
This game doesnt take skill
I will never play again
Winning the league isnt satisfying precisely because u dont have to work much towards it. U fuggin just sit there and let ur dudes play.
Lol neithrr that hundo nor the title of the league will be very satisfying so have fun
Despite whether or not it actually informed
At least in its intentions
It was more informative
I definitely wouldn't call it that
Im not sure why youre giving what i did the title of "complain" with all of the negative connotations that comes with it but
Dont challenge me boi
Ur dumb mo
??? Why woulf i not want to tell others about the potential discomfort they might experience??? Cmon boi committing fallacies up in here (causal oversimplification)
Dumby
0 emotions. Ur the emotional one dumbu
^^^
U wont
Plz quote
Plzzz
Quote what was emotional
Hahahah look at every thing i said
Cmon now
Calling me names and shit
Why is this kid getting emotional lol
Lemme find it
I definitely remarked about it at 1-0
Whatt
Didnt matter my record
I felt the same at 1-0, 1-1, 2-1...
Did u read my derision of fantasy up there? If u had u might think differently of these matters
Soo uh who still cares about fantasy?
No way lol
Carr*
If i had ur qb tho Derek care i prolly would have picked up prescott too tho. Its not like that was a pick that u needed to be highly informed about to take a shot at.. The dude took them to the nfc championship in his rookie yr
I guess prescott was a decent pickup
Who else did u try ur hand at in waivers
Cohen has fizzled out to what we thought he was gonna be. Charles didnt do anything
What waivers have u even had that were good other than jake elliot z lol
Not enough to beat a dude who has a gurly or hunt or elliot nah z
It being your chief preoccupation that day: not chill
Lol ya having it on in the background is chill
Lolol
Soo many flags
The fuckin flags
Exactly
Lolol
To watch
I still think theyre fun
And the packers too
Ya ill prolly just watch scores and highlights hereafter
Now i remember why i stopped watching it
Nfl is soooo boring
Even when i won it wasnt fun. Watching the nfl sucks. I relearned that too so far this month
A better question: why did i allow myself to get hyped when i was quite convinced that fantasy was like this
Lol well why the fug did u get us hyped for fantasy this yr!
Are u insinuating that what im saying is old news lol
Thats all im arguinf
But people who have better teams do not have them owing to any kind of special knowledge or experience with fantasy or the nfl
Lol true
I could rotate all the sleepers in my lineup i want! When gurley gives u 30 a game whats the point!
More or less
U just fuckin choose the next dude in line that your predraft ranking has listed
Id wager that if u analyzed every single fantasy draft that occurred, there is hardly any variance with respect to which players are chosen in which spots.

Where is the skill in that people?
Byt fantasy football doesnt really admit of that kind of thing^
Tbh i kind of feel similarly about being a head coach of any sport with recruiting/drafting players.

Like once your program has the stature of an Alabama, and the consequently get the top recruits every year is it even satisfying for saban anymore? Like any person with a brain could just look at the high school recruit rankings and pursue the best ones if they had a Program as prestigious as Alabama.

Starting a Program from scratch and scouting the lesser valued players and building that program is where all the fun lies.
When my fuckin little niece can go and follow the pre draft rankings and draft a winning team thats how u know this shits dumb
In short: fantasy football sucks and i feel bad for any of yall if u intend to do it in the future
In fantasy baseball there are legitimate "moneyball" opportunities i.e. possibilities of forming a solid team from waiver pickups and small transactions.

In fantasy football it doesnt fuggin matter who what petty player i pickup from the waivers: kareem hunt and todd gurley are still gonna fuck me in the ass week in and week out.

The top 100 free agents for any fantasy baseball league are almost assuredly dudes who see nearly as many opportunities for points as the best dudes in the league.

Go to our top 100 waivers and these motherfuckers hardly see the ball but maybe had one breakout week that put them up there otherwise theyre trash
Ok
For cheap
Matt ryan on the block
Safety i think
Russell better get it together matt
Lol
Ur kicker and dak carried
I would have started him if i had him too lol
Ur kicker was ur whole team

Just keep 17 off
Revert back to schedules
Group Bitch voted for "Yes" in the poll: reset?
Just revert back to og settings
Vote on it
Lets do that
Ya
Try it
U understand now matt
Were playing someone less
That means were not playing someoen
Why would we play someone 3 tiems.
Like normal
Lets spread the games played
Change this
No nonno
I play sister 3 times...
Lets switch this back rigjt neil
Idk ur playing zach again
Im playing my week 1 opponent
My matchup is messed up too
Wait
Ur playing neil i thought
Lol wtf
Maybe
Maybe neil
Stafford for gore
Ajayi for ryan
Lol sister has hunt
Id be willing to gibe u matt ryan. But obvi ud have to give me someone nice
Does stafford qualify?
What does smart mean neil?
By the measure of the utility calculus matt, 6 spots is optimal
There are 2 more peoples well beings at stake if 6 spots are available for playoffs. That is 2 more periods during which pleasure is generated
Copy paste
U never explained
Im wondering why that mattera
Yes 6 teams
Right pep
Salt^
Thats it i want cobb and i want him now
Hes used more than i thought he wouod be in new englands offense
Hogan might actually have a solid yr
and the biggest blockbuster of the year for alexxander @Alex Pepke
Lol no
...
Adams for abdullah
U.. U called it at the start of the yr didnt u
Hes got the most rec yds on the browns this yr
Lol i was kinda going to ask u for duke
whats the trade
Check the projected scores thiz week
Lol sike. Imma stomp u z
Matts a dictator thats why
Cringe
If we keep it at 4
Lol whoever loses the vince mike matchup is very likely eliminated from playoffs
Group Bitch voted for "6 teams" in the poll: how many teams.
So kartik now that youre on the losing end of the stick
Thats the only way things in this league gonna get done it seems
Lol srsly
I think its top 2 in each and then the next best 2 records
What scenario is more unfair that im going towards?
I wanted a hybrid between total points and head to head actually where u take the average from your position in both those standings
^
Ur the one creating the slippery slope matt lol
?
Lol im down
I think it has too much weight as is
Why 3 seed should smash them
So idk what u talking about
Why. U fuggin changed the veto policy and i sure as hell didnt want that shit
An*
Im a intellectual neil. Thats what i do
I would vote for 6 teams regardless of whether i was in or out or whether the change would put me in or out.

I think it would be more fun that way.

I see what u guys are saying tho. U value the the regular season performance highly and want teams to get punished for doing poorly in the reg season.

But im arguing that while i agree that we should value regular season performance we should also value making it more fun for as many teams as possible.

So we should find a balance between those 2 values. And 4 team playoff seems to favor the reg season value a little much.

I think 6 teams in playoffs would still observe that one value while also observing the other
Thats just false
They only have a chAnce....
Thats just the thing wete not far at all into the season
Tho
What does week 12 have to do with week 3
That were 3 games in
I still dont know why that matters
Lets do majority vote. I still dont know why we wouldn't do majority vote lol
Nah mo also said 6 teams
Deeezzz?
Z is getting so many sacks
Z i told u to go with home defense
and can neil surpass the proficient @Vincent Maltese
glorious it would be pep
mo @Muhammed Dean Latif
u have a shot to take down the titan of premature shittalking
dont let me start with your cirucmstances
and u pep
u got a shot to take down the best tonight
this is what dreams are made of
here we go z baby
I got a trade offer that is gonna make u wet ur jimmies
lets get busy
yo matt imma pm u a trade
neil what if i went and told your mother how u behaved in this chat? would she be pleased with u
lolol
neil were u a bully in highschool
this league needs me
who am i kidding
ya right. im wining this whole thing anyway
quit
i quiy
well u know what then @Matt Wilfert
Do u even logic
Cmon neil. Get yo head in the game
If pep beats mo (which will prolly happen)  it will be 4-3 loonies over non loonies for playoff contention
Smh
Smh neil
Yo*
Even if pepke loses me and mo are tied with u
Do to math boa
U stupid neil? If pepke beats mo then me mo and pepke are tied with u guys
That is majority preference
Lets leave them to preference
Why are we leaving matters like this to chance
Why is that relevant
Your point neil?
Let this be a democracy!
Of course both of these things are gonna be influenced by that
Psh ya they are and were
Lets be consistent here
Be
Thats how yall wanted vetos to bw
Why shouldn't the majority get to decide
Right z
Why would that be the case
That would make it more fun for 2 more teams
Ok so what
Y
U agree with who matt
^
Ur mean neil!
Group Bitch voted for "6 teams" in the poll: Playoffs.
lol true
home teams have a notably better win pct across all sports
but it also makes u vulnerable to plays where dez hurts u both with his pts and pts against your d
theyre at home
z maybe start az d?
Id take zs spot ez
Zs up 6. Hes got his defense left. Matts got dez bryant
Zs winning
yo neil i want hogan and cobb
In a sunday night blockbustee
And a brown is dealt again
Wow
U little ugly!
Me!... Sike u bum ass nigga
Im the best in this league!
My teams taking it all this yr
Shut ur southern European mouth
I hope u lose this week chump
Phuck u
Prolly 10 and tps tho
Its
Ita close
Or fitz and bailey
Tps and a 10 pt cushion
So u need to hope that fitz sucks
His kicker will prolly get him 10
U prolly
My boi p
Lol. Still adds the "to"
Ur team garbage tho
Then isnt it
Its a good thing i dont have him :)
Def not for just cobb
Nope cobb and henry. Maybe not even still for those 2
And then maybe
Switch cousins for cobb and hogan for henry
And id be strengthening ur qb position
What would be the point of me accepting that trade? I wouldn't use either cousins or Hogan.
Who isnt a qb
Substitute cousins for someone good
Lol neil if ur gonna offer me a trade dont send me a qb plz
Pepke!
Eric Alfonso left the group.
Thats a smart man right there^ bois. Imma follow suit. I suggest all the sane members of this chat join us
Pshh then ud get ur ass beat
Lol kartik if everyone in this league were in the same room u wouldnt be saying that i promise u
Heh...
Nobody wants that garbo
Eww
Lol
so zachs best player for a shitty ass flex and neils bench player
Jeez mike. B marsh..
Lol i think peps fucked
Staff a beast
I wwnt more
Ya i prolly wasnt gonna do it either
Now were talking neil
Lol
Fleener for blunt
True
Ur gonna have to give a lot to get him
No way did they matt
I think its a necessary book
Lol i actually respect her decision to do that
Omg i cant believe how funny u are
Hahaha man youre so funny
My mom literally goes to school and has 3 jobs. She still has free time. Less be real
Well surely they have some free time!
I think this league would be vastly more fun if neil chris and kartik didnt just spam one liners and actually defended their claims and talked civilly
Thats where the real men shine!
Or we can settle it with some good ole argumentation!
Go home kart and chris write something down and make it suspenseful. And dont come back till something dope hit u. Matter fact u can take the mic home with u. Looking like a cyclone hit u
Hahahaha
First
Yall bitches go firsy
Im giving chris and kartik the mic. Im like eminem
Forget gpas. They got the chance to redeem themselves right now
Lol
How bout u chris. Why did u say to kartik " plz read when u get the chance"
Would u mind explaining about what u are cringing
"Im cringing so hard..." -kartik
Instead kartik and chris just snicker like little children
Id love to see any one of them step up
Just the 3 amigos
Ur fine
Not u matt
To a noble*
So the task is probably foreboding
Nah i just dont think yall are accustomed to actually explaining your conclusions to noble extent
1 sentence*
Neils 1 word replies are provocative in their own right
And non fallaciously
Im typing rationally
Ur the dude whos being provocative
Then keep going
Unless u like that
Stop sucking neils Dick
Nobody was talking to u bud
Chris
Capacity to give a decent response*
Id wager the former
Lol do u post 1 sentence replies because you lack the mental capacity to or is it owing to a general indifference to gratify me a worthy response
at any rate neils argument seemed to be this: 

If any players tend to put up a lot of points one week and not much another week then theyre inconsistent.

if theyre inconsistent then they will get "punished" more in head2head than total points because if a player scores few points in a given week  it is less likely for that team to win that week if its head to head. If its total points then the inconsistent players dont get punished because their low point followed by high point weeks will affect the total points without any negative outcome like the head2head which probably gave that team a loss.



my reply:
why would they need to get "punished" tho? in head2head a loss during your inconsistent players week will probably be followed by a win in his dominant week

In total points a bad week followed by a good week puts you around average

last time i checked a 1 win 1 loss record was around average
uncertain
there is no justifiably accounting for what is unceratin
uncertainty by the only definiton i know of it literally means "that which is unknown"

how can u possibly account for that which is unknown
what
lolol
right?
and we want to make it as skillful as posisble right with the least amount of chance or luck
lol
in the league
so we need to take into consideration the net pleasure and pain felt
vince is prolly not feeling to happy bout that
yet lost
he outscored almost the whole league
for a dude like v@Vincent Maltese who got jipped this week
but does it actually make it more fun tho
too
ya thats what mo said
lol u can defnitiely tweak it to make it more fair
or next yr
for arguments sake
im just speaking hypothetically
ya im not bringing this total points alternative up with the mindset of actually making this happen
i could give u the definition that i am using for that word
not as fair
in view of fairness
hence im doing it objectively
tthan i am with head to head
its not like id be any better off
that means that im not doing this with a bias
exactly
lol
Is what im not understanding
How is this relevant to head to head vs total points?
I..i dont understand
What u mean i can play according to head to head
But i dont actually see why we should value consistency
Lol nah
What u mean
If so why?
Should we even value consistency in this league anyway?
But my next question is
Actually nvm i see what youre saying
Ya but explain to me why that scenario spells worse for a player in a total points league versus a head to head
Lol
Why wouldnt consistency matter
Those chance scenarios are the ones were trying to eliminate. And total points does that
Idk how chris argument was a refutation of that
Thats what im saying
Ya exactly v
Or to what argument rather
To whom are u responding chris
Right guys
Huh
A bad week will prolly get u a loss. And a loss is literally worthless. Whereas if it was based on total points u at least get some points to add to your total
Pep
How do u figure prp
I kind of think non head 2 head is more fair
Lol
Im a loser!
Ok agholor and martavis on the block
Fleeenerrr
Lolol
Lol not many of our dudes play
Lol
Hes on the block
Ok who wants martavis
Group Bitch joined the group call.
thats when u know
zach has a te playing flex....
Cuz it wont last long
Mire everything i have graced this chat with
Dont hide it youre mirin
My writing is so good isnt it chris
I fancy myself to be
Now. I would be happy to discuss logic with u Kartik. The only question is: are u equal to the task?
Kartik if you desire that this season be good for everyone i should like that u begin explaining the reasoning behind some ofnthe conclusions u draw. That goes for chris and neil too.

Inb4 one of u 3 clowns mocks this^^
Im only free if u want to teach me
Never
Are u ever gonna stoop down to my level and teach me.master kart?
Lets be real
Kart makes it cringe
Lol
I concede
Youre smarter than me
Ya know what kart youre right
What are we gonna do with u
Kart kart kart
To flex your intellectual muscles
This is your moment to shine kart
Cmon dont begrudge us of a lecture
Give us a lecture for once kart
Show me kart
Howd i do it incorrectly
To*
2 predictbale kart and neil
Inb4 kart or neil say something ro the effect of endorsing that behavior too
Lol
Classic defense mechanism for being called our for being wrong^.^^
Its killin u
U stupid? He drafted obj round 1. Kart how many times we gotta tell u lay off the weed
Emphatically*
I could reductio chris' assertion so easily but... Its gettin old isnt it
Lol
U too neil
See kartik an unobservant dude like u wouldnt have caught that grammatical mistake
Mike and me*
We just pickef up fire flame
Expect mike and i this weekend
Wheres the accountability right mike
Peppppp
Is it involuntarily
Do u try to be really stupid with everything u say or
Lol
Group Bitch voted for "Eric Alfonso" in the poll: Who has the shittiest starting lineup for week 2?
So cringe
Montgomery gonna outperform ajayi. Nobody wants that pussy
Niggas got bust written all over him
Why else would i want to trade him
Haha obvi. Why else would kartik eant to trade him
Vagina
Remember kartik. Ajayi doesnt leave tonight u vaginga
Kart... Youre uhh acting a littlr different. U alright bro
D wat is natty
D wauttt
Not this again
That was a monster reception
Haha
If he were a product im selling him
Just doesnt distinguish himself amidst the rest of the rbs in the league
Vince your rb1
ahh gotcha
one more time now
your boi deandre?
Ive been hounding pepke for tate since like day 1
And u send it thru right now

This one dudes riding a 24 game losing streak over 3 seasons in fantasy lololol
Ull see
Its hilarious. Everyone can relate
Lol read that
It uh scares me too
Heh
U guys are bullies!
thats all
im just trying to understand u so that i can answer your original questions to me chris
then*
answer the question i posed up there
well the chris. u take neils spot
or was that not the proper pragmatic inference to draw given neils previous history of coments?
so im looking for neils explanation
because neils comment "lay off the weed" indicates to me that he beileves those words are easily understood
go on @Neil Nijhawan
what are the conditions under which one can justifiably ascribe that predicate to a subject/?
neil. a bully is a predicate right? a predicate being something which can be ascribed to a subject.

for instance in the sentence "Eric is a bully"  "Eric" is the subject and "bully" is the predicate ascribed to that subject.

now neil. i want u to tell me how the predicate "bully" is universally ascribed?
what is a philosopher?
what is a bully?
I want to learn logic kart. From u only tho!
Ur a dodger brah. U could play for los angeles
To answer
R u 2 stupid?
Kartik stop dodging us
Dont they pep
These commands to look it up ourselves sound like pretenses of him being ignorant on the matter
Well were waiting
Ok kartik. First question: what is logic
Theyre the downfall of humanity
smh
keyboard warriors man
who wants a lecture on logic from the master logician @Kartik Hegde
all the stuff ive said
the thign is i would easily say those things to u irl
idk why ur putting on this front
lol
u would never say tthese things to me irl
well its not gonna hurt to try! itll sharpen your logical skills too!
be our guest @Kartik Hegde
give us a lecture on logic
the whole chat
why dont u give us a whole lecture @Kartik Hegde
begin plz
this is gonna be funny
plzzz doo
yessss
ill show u how to read one if u want
u ever seen one?
u know what one of those are
go read a book @Kartik Hegde'
im glad to be white shit
nigga cmon
and my shit talk way better
im way more funny
ur literalyl not funny at all
who doesnt?
i despise kids like u
ur like a robot
kartik read a fuckin book kid. your jokes are stale
Lol
Buncha fuglies in there?
Well kartik lost all credibility with his ajayi leaves tonight bs
Well take philosophy of mathematics and maybe u wont make these mistakes!
An unending amount of times actually
Youd have to prove the inductive hypothesis a million tiimes
Because theres nothing bridging the gap between the inductive hypothesis "if this animal is living then this other animal is living" and what you want to prove in any induction namely that "every animal is living".

How are u supposed to go from your inductive hypothesis tonyoue conclusion without any kind of bridge (successor function)
Wihtout a successor function matt im afraid youd have to prove that animals have the property say "living" going. ..... One at a time!!
I live for this logic shit
Fuck fantasy neil
Thus we use those in proving the inductive hypothesis. Proving an inductive hypothesis without such clear "givens" would be a tall task
Well ordered sets already have some fixed properties which we assume in mathetmatical induction e.g. Successor and a least value
Try to use a base case to prove any single property about the set of animals
Take the set of animals for instance
Because only on those sets is it really possible to prove things about every member of the set
For instance the natural numbers
Mathematical induction only works on relatively well ordered/well defined sets
Get your head outta ur ass matt!
Lol matt believing that he was using mathematical induction yesterday when he was simply trying to reductio pep
Now we got a real loony running the show
Our
Why did u elect trump to be oue leader u stinky head!
Nah that just doesnt fit right fuys
Both
At once!
Tell us all!
Why are u a republicuck matt!
Which was kinda disturbing to hear about a candidate for presidency
By voting trump
Theyre kinda promoting or at least admissing clear acts of sexism imo
I mean....
U mean to tell us Ur a racist
Wtf!
How far (gone) right are u matt?
Matt are u ever gonna come over to the... Libcuck side
When we smokin a blunt kart?
Lol
Too predictable really
Too true
U 2 funny matt
Hahahaah
Hahaaha
Do u know the forms breh
Srslt kartik
Lolol
Apparently
What is logic... Kartik
Lol
Ya and youre giving a scenario aka a reductio counteeexample.. The one about losing all your rbs
Induction is for proving that if one thing has a property a whole set of things does
Not*
Ur*
Lol. Ue using induction. Thats not appropriate here matt. What youre actually trying to do it seems is reductio peps general statement namely that "trades should nor exist"
U eristic ****
Hey matt its not a competition
In
Lol
Im dying
Hababah
Hahahahaah
I know lol
Aj green good?
We talkin julio jones good?
How good we talkin
Who u tryna get for him
U*
Nope i swore
U swore
W.e. ur time running out. U have to deal ajayi now
Unless u on west coast or mountain
Im afraid tonight ends in 4 minutes kartik. And that makes u a hype
Ur gonna think my roster is genious after i get done with u
Are u ready to get pounded this Sunday matt
Wrong
Do it u wont
What happened with that
Soo uhh. About that whole ajayi leaving tonight business
Anomaly!
Umm ur bad
u can guess which side i stand on
others DOWNGRADES!
some would call them improvements.. heh
lol
my d/st report*
thats my teams report
recognize
thats right bois
The star-studded Seattle defense held Green Bay off the board for the first half and is the top D/ST to have in Week 2 at home against San Francisco, which mustered only three points in the season opener at home to Carolina.
and it didnt help that i gifted him another
kartik is hogging the rb1
kartik got like 4 or 5 rb1
didnt sanders have an ass performance week 1
lol
the league
and rearrange
everyone dissemble their roster
hahaha
lol why are u crafting this ajayi leaves tonight narrative
lol. thats a player short of what brown was traded for
is whats happening
cooper for ajayi!
Cuz i already got the east locked
Pep u better takes the reins of the west
Lol
Ur team garbage tho
interesting matt
lol matt dropped jags d and picked up giants d
just to say u have him
im surprised u havent picked up trubisky yet
z has way too much bias towards bears players. hes had 5 bears pieces total, including their defense... the bears suck tho... that bias is killing u z
Z should have been more active in the trade market. Hes gonna be paying for it heavily in the coming weeks. He already paid for it week1
And by the looks of his team lol
In this chat so far
Given most of his statements made
I honestly wouldnt doubt it
Lol
I thought we was homies
Why u so meam kart
Insomuch that it might warrant....... Total banishment
The... The crime of extortion iss a highly punishable offense here in the loony bin league
me!
Tard
Yes
LOL
Have u or neil played an organized  sport before LOL
Neil and kartik yall are prettt quiet
 Whats up
Sure he is
Lololol
Idk
Heres what the loonies would have: 1 college football player. 1 college basketball player. Several highschool football players.

Heres what the non loonies would have: oh wait they aint got shit
Wouldn't even be worth our time

Martin who isnt available till week 5
So really just martin for crowell. Cuz those other 2 are dead weight
Its a good thing it dont matter what u think
A brown is really hankering to get dealt in our league isnt he
I think hyde and pryor for gurley is fair
Why would i want him back
I fuckin gave u garcon
....
Still
Ok i want martin
Nobody that im looking to give u really lol
In an offense that passes a lot
Hes redskins top wr
Gurley for hyde and pryor sr

Im willing to put hyde and pryor sr
Everyone list what theyre willing to put on the table

In the league
Ok heres gonna be the first mega deal
Yes and yes
....
Ok who wants to be a 3rd party in my trade with matt
Uhh

Pep intended to bench tate tho
Then ittl be fair
Kearse and riddick
Lol give him kearse and someone else mike
I Dont believe

Ohh shitt
Snead
Lolol
On the field
Is like a little boi
Mcaffrey....
Murray for hyde
Ok pep i want Murray
Lolol
U didnt actually offer that did u
....
There isnt even an explanation attached
Is what im arguing
Not saying im better. Merely citing what some analysts say isnt that convincing tho
So
Top analysts at espn also said abdullah getting more points than dez cooper and hopkins
He might be only a bit better than kearse in terms of production. The trade is definitely not laughable
Not that valuable
Dudes old and slow
I doubt hell do much this yr
Fuckin*
Frnak gores a fucjin grampa
I dont even think frank gore trade was very lopsided
Which amounts to the same thing i guess
The rest were honestly eithe r close to even or hardly lopsided
But that was the only really dumb one
No obvi that was dumb
But to each his own i guess
Lol i honestly disagree with a lot of these trades being voted on
Ok lets be real here yall. Who yall bringing in tomorrow off the waivers? Cmon i know lowkey all of yall have several waiver orders waiting to fill tomorrow or the next day
And that right there summarizes fantasy trading
Fantasy trading sucks for these reasons.

Ideally youre not looking to give up a starter in a trade: as youre looking to keep your starters intact for after all you probably drafted most if not all of them.

If you are willing to part with a starter you obviously want what you feel is an advantageous return for dealing a starter--otherwise you wouldnt make the trade because if u feel u stay the same in talent then whats the point of trading at all and if you go down in talent from the trade then obvi youre not satisfied.

So for the most part youre only willing to use your bench players as trade bait.

However if u dont feel like someone is gonna give u a potential starter for any or a few of your bench players then you probably wont bite because what use is it to u if u gain just another player who will ride the bench.

But realistically nobody really wants to give u any player who can be a potential starter for your bench players.
I like where youre going with this
Yessss
Hahaha
Expect an offer forthwith
Im looking to avail myself of this rb sale
With who lol
Yo matt ill take ty Hilton if youre benching him :)
But ayy whatever it takes to get the job done

Do u thrive in those environments matt
What an award to win too huh
If nothing else zach wins the good guy of the league award
I think if anyone needs a trade badly its zach. His team is straight ass. I mean he has Ingram and peterson starting. We need go no futher
But
I mean shit yall crazy unconditionally

Neils coming for u matt
Looks like a beast
Wow melvin gordon
this is gonna be hilarious
for either pep or @Vincent Maltese
lol its literally demayrious vs emmanuel ftw
And it counts
Fuck amari cooper. Kartiks got diggs
diggs is the best reciever in the league apparently
ingram
why would he ever start both peterson and ingrma
i know lol. idk why zach put so much weight on the saints backfield doing well
with zach only having peterson and ingram left
i predicted you would win
ya
wow diggs might actually be a nice little piece this year
Ayy z cmon
nice try mo right @Matt Wilfert
7 rushes for 16 yds
last night lol
didnt perkins have like less than 30 yds
Your team definitely in a worse position than u think
And your jags defense gave u 29 points.... Ill bet u 100$ they dont replicate that again all season
Pshh. With the Johnson injury your running backs are now milquetoast
Matts team.took a big hit
Wow
Collapse
Lol the collapsw of baylor football
That d johnson wouldn't miss any time
Lets renegotiate that trade ehh matt
Lol idk where matt getting his news but
Send it thru
Deal
Youre an L7 weenie
Yup
A more reliable indicator right pep
True
Beware
Ayy brady making a mid season push
Lol
Which was majority of game iirc
He uh didnt do too well in the time he played week 1
Then
If he was out half the seasom
I read something saying half the season at first
I agree
And that does make our offer lopsided
That is welcome news for u matt
Link
Well find out
Idk
^^
Mentioning the amount of time that tier one will miss is important with regards to his value no?
On what grounds?
@Matt Wilfert
And u believe that the offer i proposed was such an instance?
W.e.
Cooper for adams and d johnson
Hes too valuable
Lol. Cooper gonna get so many targets this yr if week 1 is any indication
Alright fine matt. What do u want for d adams.
Against a defense that is not currently owned by anyone in our league
How many pts did wilson have?
Lets lock this in
Stafford had 26 pts against one of the top defenses
For*
Matts in a bad qb situation. Lets do Stafford foe d adams
What about them
Kirk weak
Cough cough neil.
Hes on the block for relatively cheap for anyone in a dire qb situation
26pts
Hes my qb2
Who wants Matthew stafford. He had 4 tds against Arizona week 1
Ok gimme cobb
Minus the a*
Dear Matthew. I am looking to acquire davante adams from your possession. How much shall you charge for him. There must be a an opponents discount considering were playing week 2
Nah pack d is pretty good
But w.e.
Prolly a top 3 team ez
Hahaha
What u want
Yo neil i want cobb
Theyve had hill and bernard there for a while. I doubt mixon would come in and uproot them so fast.
Im like brah hes literally spitting so hard with hill and bernard
Youre like nah i think hes gonna be a breakout player
Lol mixon matt. I told u he was splitting hard and wasnt gon a do jack
Bailey is killin it for him
Pepke could win this week lol
Vince
Johnson
I want david johmson
Lolol
Im taking offers starting tonight
That my friends is ty Montgomery
Lol
Obvi
U didnt take me seriously
I told u vince was a juggernaut pep
The backfield for new Orleans
Zach only has 2 dudes left
Even tho he was talkijg hella shit
To kartik
Omg im pretty sure zachs gonna lose lol
U got a steep hill to climb week one against the juggernaut vince
And your wr1 out tomorrow isnt he pep
Cmon pep thats your qb1
Need
Cept for me.. I dont neef that shit
May the fantasy gods be with you all tomorrow
Eric Alfonso left the group.
stop inviting me to this chat. talking with these fools is not salutary
whatchu doin
stay off that weed dog
cmon @Neil Nijhawans
until montgomery gets on my team breh
how about no
let me think real quick
hmmm
hmm let me remind myself what occurred when i wanted your backup te
u have 5 dudes to get u like 80 pts neil. i mean its not impossible. but unlikely
stay in yo lane
give up
boa u easily lost
neil talking the most shit. and takes that hard L week 1
best team in teh league hands down!
nice team!
nice team neil!
i know u salty boa
but ayy u takign that L week 1 @Neil Nijhawani
actually no he didnt that was gurley
ya
my rb2 hyde had more pts last yr than gordon so
Eric Alfonso left the group.
to throw to
graham
who does wilson have other than baldwin and grahan
how much u wanan bet
that will compensate for sanders brown
a rodgers will literalyl do that much better than wilson
if russell puts up "points" a rodgers puts up "POINTS" is what im countering with @Matt Wilfert
i mean. u can offer a counterargument instead of just voicing the statement that my argument has a certain quality
oh
l2logic
cmon @Matt Wilfert
why would the trades still be dumb if arugments are strong
wouldnt that make them dumb arguments.?
so idk what u talking about
sanders is pretty good dude. his gap below brown is about the same as the gap between a rogers and russell wilson
Get outta here
Pshh rodgers will fuck wilsons mommy
I just argued the oppsite matt
How do u figure
Losing a brown
But it is a huge downgrade too
Huge upgrade for matt
Lets be honest
A rodgers way better than russell wilson
Nah
The other trades didnt have that quality
I think this trade is fair precisely because matt has to give up something worthy to obtain something worthy
Ur corrupt matt!
Lol
To not veto*
Let it be known that a colluder is willing to veto
To call it fair
Brown is wortht enoufh
I dont think i would veto that
Wow
Lololol
Lol
Literally never
In what world would anyone trade their rb1 for a te
Right
Ya rigjt
Pshhh
What will it take to get travis kelce neil
I dont think pep is relinquishing Brady for anything
We gucci
W.e. i got other offers for ajayi
That makes ajayi more valuablr
But elliot also prolly sitting out 6 games
Obvi
I think its even
But with thay in mind
If elliot wasnt sitting out id agree chris
Lol
U like that or no
Ok. Send me a trade
Ill be waiting for offers
Ok ajayi on the block
Martavis*
Theyre on the block
Yo who wants martavid bryant or john brown
Stay in yo lane neil
Furreal
Furrwal m8
Nice ad hominem. I love it neil
Good one
Guarantee i know more than u
Like organized football
Lets be real
Brah
Neil have u even ever played football brha
Packers are gonna be running predominantly 3wr 1 te 1rb sets.

Given that they are gonna do this often cobb will be in the wr3 slot position. Lets make a side bet on this
Got*
Gort*
Plus they just for martellus bennett
I mean hes good. But hes their slot receiver. Aka wr3
One game
Cool
Im a packers fan
I literally watch every packees game
Are ahead of him
Adams and nelson
Promise u
Cobbs gonna be the packers wr3
Cobb is rodgers favorite target... Uhh idk where u got that one from lol
A ruthless, despotic one
Ur a mean commisioner matt!
Lol
My argument showed 4 or 5 was optimal to prevent corruption to our league trades
Nah
Lolol
Everyone ought to peel their ears
See neil when u argue as well as ya boi here
Much
But 6 is too mucj
More than 4
Ya i think it should be 5. Thats what i thought it should be initially
So the 2 of 4 (50%) part was kinda irrelevant
I cant imagine yall think they should
I mean even i dont think cheaters vetoes ought to count
So i was using your guys own reasoning and showing u that its not optimal for our league
U guys dont want to allow cheaters vetoes to count i thought?
I was just confused why youre taking into account the cheaters votes at all
No but. My thought experiment was such that if any single person cheats their vote is not taken into account and why would it be? 

So idk why youre counting 2 of 4 of the cheaters because literally their votes oight1not to count
Wait i dont understand what youre saying
Ya but didnt matt change it to 6
Were*
Not 6
And given that occurred how many vetoes was appropriate by my demonstration? 4
Ok bois a very ez argument for why 4 or 5 vetoes is just right for a league of 10. 6 vetoes for a league of 10 is appropriate in less scenarios than 4 or 5 as shown below.

Suppose 0 ppl cheat. Then majority is 6.

Suppose 1 person cheats. Then 9 votes. Majority is 5.

Suppose 2 people cheat. Then 8 votes majority still 5.

Suppose 3 ppl cheat. Then 7 votes and majority is 4.

Suppose 4 ppl cheat. Then 6 votes majority is 4.

If 5 motherfuckin people cheat which is half the league then our league is fucked anyway and no majority of votes can be gotten.


And im using the word "cheat" loosely insomuch that it ranges over things like someone losing much interest in the league and thus not caring if they give up all their good players
and u gonna regret badmouthing him
lol week 1 hyde gonna run all over your panthers d pep
Too ez neil
Too ez
Its a reductio lol. Its just a hypothetical scenario in which your general rule, namely that 6 players ought to agree for something to be vetoed is plagued by a counterexample which is judged to be bad by our intuitions
Omg i can give the easiest reductio for why 6 is too much. Check this yall: suppose for reductio a person desires to cheat in the league. He goes to another member of the league and says:"yo sell your good players and ill give u cash lowkey." 

So the briber doing something forbidden by the league obviously shouldn't have a say in the veto process for he naturally wants his team to be good so hes biased. Tl

That means that there are 9 other players whos votes are legitimate. 

Last i checked majority is 5 relative to 9
Just wow
Wow
Mine have gone thru ;)
No single sovereign will rule this league
Srsly tho
Lololol
Check peps screenshot. The title of the chat is call "the colluders". Do u suppose that pep would name it that with sincerity. Doubtful. There exists no collusion just a small consensus that the trade did not turn out to be fair by our definition
That we were in on these vetoes the whole time
Nobody was supposed to know
Lolol pep u just revealed our hidden chat!!!
Get rekt matt
Lolol
U like it?
Yo matt lets strike up a deal: im thinking Ajayi and terrel pryor sr for antonio brown
He had superior players at that position
Garcon was on his bench not likely to start
Is legitimate
The second reason he gave tho
Peps fibbing
Lol obviously spreading the wealth isnt a legit reason
Pep had like 5 bomb receivers before i got garcon
Srsly
Lolol
It*
U had the power to veto itm but u prolly thought it was a harmless trade
U should have vetoed then. How am i a hypocrite. I would only be a hypocrite if i said "nah neil u cant veto my trade"
Why
Muahahhha
Lol
Fug what they think
Gimme the tldr
Tldr
Hardly an rb1
Not an rb1
Nah
Mah
Ehhhh
Have*
Ur asking way too much for crowell given that u havs elliot and Gordon already imo
Let me scout your roster real quick
who wants ajayi!
So lets talk deals
The*
Back when my deals were all thr rage
I see u
I see u matt
Matt using the reductio up there
Lol
If my pms are any indication of the fact
Well golly it sounds like everyone wants ajayi
Im waiting Neil
Lol
Do ya now
Ohh uhh
Anyone watching this game?
Im a prophet
Damn bois francois
Along with green
He was willing to give either peterson or ingram
Idk
Should i do it
Z baby wants ajayi for aj green and mark ingram
Lol i thought so
Not hard enuf for me to veto
But
Tbh
Ur losing it
Nah
Slight enuf that its still fair
I think u lose mo. But only slightly
Or rather mike says u offered it
Im kinda surprised youre accepting that
I wont veto that
At least mo knows how to make fair deals up in this bitch
But
Not sure what veni vidi vici has to do with anything
Nah right kart
Ok were done here
Lelelel abdullah more projected pts than d hopkins
More*
Alright now
Abdullah has motr projected fantasy pts than amari cooper....
How the fuck
Hes got projected pts than almost all my team
Wow theyre expecting abdullah to have a sensational season
I just refuse to believe that any sober person made that prediction
How in the world do they predict ameer fuggin abdullah to have mor pts than dez
Nah i disagree eith those projections. I want to see their reasoning behind
Who in their right minds WOULD EVER predict that
Espn projections just lost credibility
Wtf is this espn projections
That world in which abdullah is projected to get more fantasy pts than dez bryant
K i will
That trade idnt parallel. But it was close enuf
Unless diggs snead are getting identical stats
Well i called a trade which assuredly lean at least marginally one way (diggs snead) essentially parellel.

So anything with minor differences was deemed parallel. Thus major differences = not parellel=lobsided
Not parellel= lobsided.
Ur claiming that lobsided and collusion were or were not mentioned?
Insofar that id deem it parallel
I tbibk Diggs snead was about as close to parallel
For both teams
If the improvement was parallel
Only if one didnt benefit too much
That was not sufficient for me to veto
But as we saw
The Diggs snead trade might "affect" me in the slightest of ways
It merely affecting me isnt sufficient
Exactly lol
The logic of yhis chat
Huh
As i just said a couple minutes ago, a trade having an effect on me IS NOT SUFFICIENT for that trade to be denied
How theyre drawing their conclusion
I dont seem to follow
Vince can u formalize their argument
Agreed
I said that true
Thats one of the components ya
I never deemed that sufficient
I never said that if im affected then a trade cant occur
Formalize your argument
Why
True neil true
That seems to be what ur not accounting for
Letting that occur has effects on our winning and losing tho
Because i could offer a solid argument for every conclusion being subjective if u really wanna talk philosophy
What does subjective mean
It
I thought it was less lopsided than rodgers and dez trade obvi. Otherwise i wouldnt have made ot
If lobsided then seems like collusion. It could still be lobsided without collusion and i would still veto
I tried to qualify my statement using the word "seems"
If i made it seem like a trade being lobsided is always sufficient for it being collusion then im sorry i gave u that impression
Tho
I deemed the trades lobsided thi
Could be collusion idk
Quote me
When did i ever say that
U funny p
Lol
Why
Why do u think there would be no trades ever if trades were based on fairness matt
I agree pep
Seahawks defense for crowell
Ok who wants Seahawks defense. Your defense is ass neil. U should be first taker
Lol thats close to what i was thinking
And martavis cuz u need a flex kinda
Hyde cuz u need an rb2
For
Yo v ill give u hyde and martavis
Why u think so?
Let it be known
Neils driving a hard bargain for crowell
Llolol
Yall ever gotten tripped up by the turf monster
I wish i could get my hands on a comp. Typing this much on phone is annyoing
Let me add that in v
True
Why not
And thats the case
If a player is much more proven than another and there is no other reason to believe that other will turn out to close the gap between him and the proven player then the trade is unfair
Nothing would get decided
That would be ridiculous if supreme court needed unanimous
Lol ya majority z
I think if vetoing is changed at all it should be changed to 5. Obviously the 2 dudes who made the trade arent vetoing. So thatleaves 8 of us left. Majority vote of 8 is 5
If yall thought my Antonio brown trade was unfair yall could have vetoed
And others
So everything would only get vetoed if u changed
Im not vetoing everything
Cuz of u maybe
Its only bad if u make it bad
If not me thinking the rodgers and dez trades were unfair
Try to explain to me why i had zero motivation to veto the diggs and parker trades? What made the difference?
Lol
A better rb than powell?
I already expressed interest in k white
Ive been a very impudent man
Furreal tho. Ill deal hyde to u v to make up for my impudence
Inb4 neil becomes salty af
I like where this leagues headed
Now were truly meteing out justice
Letss gooo
Lelele rodgers trade got vetoed too
Nobody gets me like u pep
Lol
Am i the only one who has?
Soo uhh.. Anyone else gonna veto the rodgers trade or...
Do*
Watch francois get the d tonight agaisnt bama. Hes gonna fo poorly im calling it
Its all u
If u wanna get fucked
W.e. if yall wanna reinitiate it i wont veto.. All i gotta say is ur getting fucked mike
Ya hes more of a receiving back
Riddick?
Just as much as blount id reckon
With ameer
Will easily split
Theo riddick
Link wherr u belief that?
Tho
We do know that blouny led league in tds thi
Thats just my point v. We dont really know what abdullah capable of
Lets just consult their stats. What else we got to go off?
And as for abdullah and blount
Wr
Dez has potential to be a top 3 wr. I Dont think moncrief has potential to be even a top 15
I was describing it briefly
Its unfair advantage
Its not just advantage
Exaclty pep
Not jelly
Im vetoing one trade involving vince which he got the better end. Im vetoing another involving vince where he got fudged
Im tryna help him
So
Lol. Im def not jelly of vinces trade of rodgers
Cuz nobody was gettin fucked
I didnt veto diggs or parker
Trade
The devante parker trafe
The other wr trade im 2 lazy to look it up
And the othrr one
Diggs snead
Nah
2 ez
Ez counterexamples
Literally several trades have already gone thru
Who?
Twill*
Teill be ez
Check this modus ponens
Only trades i deem unfair
Wont
Heck naw i eont veto everything
Its just as abhorrent
Furreal tho lets get this rodgers trade vetoed
Lolol
And ill veto again! Right mo
Post reflection
U have to admit thay
U lost it
Mike veto it yourseld
We cant let that stand
Veto that shit quick
That occurred
U guys see the trade
Matt and pep
Veto
Matt
The value to the respective teams is huge
Course u can and u should mo
The fuck
U cant look at it that way
Lel
Mark Ingram
Back or not a weakness
Dont evem gotta look further
Tbh
I see a weakness in the first slot
Abdullah is better. ... Pshhh based ofd what stats or info neil
HE ALREADY OWNED A BETYER RB2!!!
Thats not hard to see
Mikes blount is literally a better rb2 than abdullah
Cuz we saving his ass
Maybe only vince will veto oit of spite. I think mike should get in his knees and be very grateful for this veto
U aint gotta tell me
Ive made my share neil
How thr fudge is that childish
Thr fuck
Thats childish
Why am i "salty" about this
Or at least i thought so
Precisely becayse nobody got fucked
Or the other one
Aka snead for diggs
Why wasnt i salty with at least some trades
Sucka
Its already in
Neil weve already done the math. My team is either as good oe better than yours. Stop
Kartik and sister. Veto those trades quick
For both trades!
Anf my veto is in!
Rodgers and dez
Lets veto both trades
Z and mo and whoever rlse stands for justice
Ur calling them dummies
Nah we said a trade was veto worthy for either collusion or lopsided
Yup
Im vetoojg
Thats it
Lets just talk about vetoing it
Dude mike u fuckim lost thr trade bad. No more talking about this
I think the rodgers trade was nearly as lopsided
Mo if u think this is veto worthy how do u not think the rodgers trade is
And i thought the rodgers trade was bad
I do
Lol
Whyd u decide to go to uiuc
Oh wow
Where do u work?
Ahh gotcha. I still have one more semester
Ya. I only knew him from that class at uiuc. Did u graduate?
From a few yrs a go in geography class
D cha is my boi
Kartik u know donald cha?
Stickboa
Shut yo goof ass up boa
No perkins
Hyde for hopkins*
If none of those are enticing then offer me something juicy for my other dude's
Here are the players im willing to trade: martavis bryant. Carlos hyde (only if i get at least a decent RB in the deal in return). And my whole bench.
Well
What trades we makin
Yo kartik
Lol
True true
Whats your team
So if my teams shit
So with your trade Neil it seems our teams are very close almost even by my judgment.
Lol neil saying my team is shit. Lets compare teams. I have u beat at more positions than not.

Matg ryan vs kirk cousins. Me.


Melvin gordon vs jay ajayi. Tie.

Crowell vs hyde. Hyde had a little more fantasy pts last yr but ill call it tied.

Mike evans vs pryor sr.
You.

Brandin cooks vs allen robinson. Close but im taking me. Cooks is bradys #1 reciever this yr. I like that too much to take Robinson.

Travis kelce vs ebron.

You

Rams d vs seahawks d. Not even close me.

Matt prater vs mason Crosby. Tie.
Ill leave it at that
I think the upgrade from cousins to rodgers is definitely bigger than from abdullah to powell
When i looked at all 10 teams in the league i honestly thought neil had one of the weakest qbs. Despite kirk posting around top 5 qb numbers last yr he lost his top two targets in the offseason ( garcon and jackson). The redskins only picked up terrrel pryor and drafted docston. So the redskins definitely got weaker in the WR department which will most likely impact kirks stats. Plus i find it hard to believe that even if the redskins receivers stayed the same cousins would not replicaTe those numbers.

Therefore neil who by my reasoning up there^ had a low tier qb at least with respect to the qbs that everyone else has in our league.

But now after this trade he has arguably the best qb in the league without having to give up almost anything of value. Its true that as we speak powell is listed as neils flex. But im very confident that that would change as soon as elliot comes back (crowell would prolly be a better replacement)
Lol ill explain
I cant be the only one
Plz tell me other ppl have problems with this trade beside me
L2logic
Even if my tea. Was trash why would that preclude me from helping others
And got an rb who splitting a lot
So u downgraded in qb vince
To both assertions
Huh?
Would u ever start kirk over brees?
So that was just worthless
Firstly u arent even gonna use kirk except maybr when brees has a bye or as trade bait
Would u accept that
The fuck
U got a backup runningback and an inferior quarterback.....
Vince u just made Neils team beastly and u didnt get shit
Im vetoing that shit
Uhhh that trade between vince and neil tho
Nice doing business with ya pep
Soo neil any word on our trade?
Pep has 5 wrs that are the primary targets for their teams. I dont think anyone else has that
Such a large disparity
Are sooo weak
But his runningbacks
Peps wrs are too ill
Neil I sent u an offer involving martavis
As matt always says
Block it or knock it
Ok
Im taking offers
Bois

"The ultimate x factor"
Ya thats right. Yall better recognize
Damn bois check whose flex is the front page top headline of espn's NFL homepage
U shitty!
Damn matt. When u really think about it....YOUR TEAM IS FULL OF A BUNCH OF SHITTIES
Thats a sketchy conditional
Is the missing premise "if a player was last yrs best fantasy player then that player is an unreliable pick
I dont see how that follows
By that reasoning alone
Lol how do u figure
Heh
Uhh
Lol ohh
Wasnt mcfadden involved?
Ohh ya
U made me an offer?
Until i get him

will do neil will do
more than a dozen touches per game... ya no thanks
thats the report for cj anderson ^ lel
" The 26-year-old is a fine post-hype target, but may struggle to receive more than a dozen touches per game."
i do like his Wrs tho
theyre all mid to low tier
lol i dont really like any of his qbs tho
as a result of our trade matts RB2 went from arguabyl one of the best in teh league to one of the worst
Now his rb2 and wr2 suck
Matt lost in depth what he gained in starpower
lolol
now lock that bitch in!
true that
^
as far as i know the trade is still pending
The recipient of Mr. Brown is Alpha Dominators
Headlines:

The most significant trade in the short history of Fantasy Football(Loony Bin) has just occurred: Team Alfonso has with much reservation, decided to part with superstar Antonio Brown, in order to acquire upcoming running back Jay Ajayi and recently sprouting Terrell Pryor Sr. 

This trade could have reverberations around the league for weeks to come

what are your needs mike
those are a solid ass 5
dez bryant. michael crabtree. brandon marshall. eric decker. mike wallace
even his backups are good
like 5 of them
he has really good receivers
i kind of like it
mikes teams honestly pretty solid

A Brown, with Matt Ryan.

well see if he holds up in teh long run
matt talking a lot of split early on huh pep
